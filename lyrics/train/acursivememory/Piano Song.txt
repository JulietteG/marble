Welcome to my dreamiest nightmare
When you're so close, but you never get there
There still some things you need to say to me
Because you're my love
You're my furthest destiny

I never thought
I'd say this again
The three words that you never said
The one phrase that breaks the heart in two
Because Angel, I love you

If I could turn the clock again
To say three words I wished I never said
Phrase that breaks the heart in two
'Cus Angel, I love you

Angel you're the closest thing I wanted most
But you still can't see it
I say five vowels and three syllables
They're noticed
And you're so dreamable

I never thought
I'd say this again
The three words that you never said
The one phrase that breaks the heart in two
Because Angel, I love you

If I could turn the clock again
To say three words I wished I never said
Phrase that breaks the heart in two
'Cus Angel, I love you

[Interlude]

If I could turn the clock again
To say three words I wished I never said
Phrase that breaks the heart in two
'Cus Angel, I love you

I never thought
I'd say this again
The three words that you never said
The one phrase that breaks the heart in two
Because Angel, I love you

If I could turn the clock again
To say three words I wished I never said
Phrase that breaks the heart in two
'Cus Angel, I love you---Lyrics submitted by Monica.
