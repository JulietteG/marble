Put it down on a shelf
Take it  one by one
You know thats alright
I can not live by the book
Cause my heart will know witch way we have to go
Didnt really want to hurt you, I was blind
Cant rely on things to save themselves you see

cause its this way if we want it
And its this way out of here
And its this way well make it
This love will lead and bloom
Yeah, this way well make it
Let our love lead and bloom
Just lead and bloom

Leave it there on the shelf
Loose your hold of the past
Well be alright
I take a leaf out of your book
Cause your heart just knows witch way we have to go
Didnt really want to hurt you another time
Cant rely on things to save themselves you see

cause its this way if we want it
And its this way out of here
And its this way well make it
This love will lead and bloom

cause its this way if we want it
And its this way out of here
And its this way well make it
This love will lead and bloom
Yeah, this way well make it
Let our love lead and bloom
Just lead and bloom

Will lead an bloom---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
