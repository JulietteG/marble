Sometimes I just feel ill 
and sometimes I just feel sick 

Mr. Sorrow I have to write this letter 
maybe I would feel much better 

My dear Mr. Sorrow 
do you need me? 

sometimes you're mesmerized by you 
then I feel like a worn out shoe 

Mr. Sorrow please leave me alone 
just for a moment I'd like to be back home 

My dear Mr. Sorrow 
do you love me? 

Sorrow (sorrow), sorrow (sorrow) - I want you to leave me 
come on (come on), come on (come on) let's say our farewells 

sometimes I don't regret 
and sometimes I wish we've never met 

Mr. Sorrow why do you torment me 
even when I smile you slap me 

My dear Mr. Sorrow 
why don't you leave? 

Sorrow (sorrow), sorrow (sorrow) - I want you to leave me 
come on (come on), come on (come on) let's say our farewells 

I won't fall into regret 
it will only make me upset 
I should have a song to sing 
to help me cope with anything 

Sorrow (sorrow), sorrow (sorrow) - I want you to leave me 
come on (come on), come on (come on) let's say our farewells 
Sorrow (sorrow), sorrow (sorrow) - why do you follow 
goodbye (goodbye), goodbye (goodbye) I say my farewell---Lyrics submitted by Jennie.
