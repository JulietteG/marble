(Verse 1)
Slowly and steadily MC's are fallin' off like leprosy 
Instead build immunity and spread insight through community
These fundamentals, form the crux of longevity 
When melodies are looped and vocals harmonize in unity 
Now, its 99 and ain't a damn thing changed 
Some seek fame as wealth manipulates the brain 
Let me, paint this picture, your minds the canvas 
Many claim their real and later flake like dandruff 
Cause 1 out of 10 stick to their words 
The other 9 stick to my Nikes and get rubbed out on the curb 
Lets be real, we're paper chasin' for financial backing 
But theres a thin line defined by greed many are passing 
Known as crossing over for exposure some embark 
Or cars, jewels and things that wont exist when we depart 
Crews, don't snooze, or both eyes become bruised 
This goes out to those that slept knew the deal or were confused
Check the Blueprint.. 

[Chorus] 
So MC's, take it back to lyricism 
Producers, pour out your heart into the rhythm 
DJ's pay bills develop skills 
And respect the architect as we begin to build 
And check the blueprint, to keep the culture alive 
And check the blueprint so as an artist you can survive 
And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills.. 
[scratch] 
So respect the architect as we begin to build 

(Verse 2)
Clutching my pen tight struggling to portray the right depiction 
I'm punching the wall of writers block, hoping for recognition 
Nowadays your not heard, unless your posing an image 
With watered down lyrics that appeal to most who listen 
Instead, Ill water the roots so branches will replenish 
Expanding elements that pioneers started building 
Hiphop houses, so many free loading MC's 
I feel theres only a few tenants who've been paying their fees 
360 degrees what goes around comes back 
I'm smoking mics as I inhale lies and exhale facts 
Unfold the blueprints, the plans for improvement 
Bridging gaps between the mind, ball point pen and the clueless 
Innovation is useless once you forget the essence 
So respect the architect, pick up your pens and start sketching  

[Chorus] 
So MC's, take it back to lyricism 
Producers, pour out your heart into the rhythm 
DJ's pay bills develop skills 
And respect the architect as we begin to build 
And check the blueprint, to keep the culture alive 
And check the blueprint so as an artist you can survive 
And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills 
[scratch] 
So respect the architect as we begin to build 

(Verse 3)
As I open my slanty eyes to this place called earth 
I contemplate how music has lost artistic worth 
And I'm shriveled up in my niche like the scrotum when its freezing 
With bags under my eyes on account of too much sleeping 
Because of these lies in rap that I can't feel 
Leaving me dazed with the phrase "I keep it real" 
How many times have you heard this being fed through your ears 
I'd rather be fed in the mouth, to spit it out from the rear 
Claiming their underground but underwater their wrinkling 
And me, like water buoys to that level I'm never sinking 
Sink your teeth into my words hard enough to be lisping
When finished biting them, find your front teeth missing 
I see em sipping fine wines in spas, to match their image 
Gimmicks.. I flap my jaws and their whole squads diminished 
I don't mess with Glocks but metaphorically in speech 
I'd like to pump em with more shots than diabetics receive 
Then in a better place may they peacefully rest 
In hopes that next time the blueprints they'll manifest 
Check the blueprints...---
