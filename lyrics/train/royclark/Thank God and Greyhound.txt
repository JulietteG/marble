I've made, a small fortune
And you've squandered it all
You shame me, til I feel about, one inch tall
But I thought, I loved you
And I hoped you, would change
So I gritted, my teeth 
And didn't complain 

Now, you come to me
With a simple, goodbye
you tell me, you're leavin'
but you don't, tell me why
Now we're here, at the station 
and you're getting on, 
And all I can think of..... Is.....

Thank God and Greyhound, you're gone!

(Chorus)
Thank God and Greyhound, you're gone!

I didn't know how much, longer, I could go on!
Watch-in you take, the respect out of me,
Watch-in you make, a total wreck out of me,
That big diesel motor, is playin' my song!
Thank God and Greyhound, you're gone!

Thank God and Greyhound, you're gone!
That load on my mind got lighter, when you got on!
That shiny old bus, is a beautiful sight
With the black smoke, a rollin', around the taillights,
It may sound kinda cruel, but I've been silent too long, 
Thank God and Greyhound, you're gone!

Thank God and Greyhound......... you're gone---Lyrics submitted by Keagen Gundersn.
