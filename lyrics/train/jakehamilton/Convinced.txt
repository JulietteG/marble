For I am convinced that when I pray
You hear me
For I am convinced that when I sing
You're near me
For I am convinced that when I pray
You hear me
For I am convinced that when I sing
You're near me

And I believe
History belongs to those who pray
History belongs to those who pray
History belongs to those who pray
History belongs to those who pray

So, I'm gonna pray 'till Jesus comes
I'm gonna pray 'till Jesus comes 
I'm gonna pray 'till Jesus comes
I'm gonna pray 'till Jesus comes
I'm gonna pray 'till Jesus comes
I'm gonna pray 'till Jesus comes
I'm gonna pray 'till Jesus comes
I'm gonna pray

You are my rock, my sword, my shield
You are the only hand that heals
You are the Lily of the Valley
The bright and Morning Star 
Shine, shine
You are the precious Lamb of God
You are the First and Last of All
I don't care what they say 
They're gonna hear me pray 

I'm gonna pray 'till Jesus comes (x7)
I'm gonna pray

You are my rock, my sword, my shield
You are the only hand that heals
You are the Lily of the Valley
The bright and Morning Star 
Shine, shine
You are the precious Lamb of God
You are the First and Last of All
I don't care what they say 
They're gonna hear me pray 

I'm gonna pray 'till Jesus comes (x7)
I'm gonna pray

I'm gonna pray, I'm gonna pray(x7)

In every congregation
In every denomination
In every church across the nation
Let Your glory fall (x4)

Let Your glory fall (x15)---Lyrics submitted by Josh.
