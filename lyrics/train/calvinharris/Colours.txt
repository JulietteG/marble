Now i dont care what you dress like
Or what you wear
But please make sure baby
You've got some colours in there
Now it's all very well stepping out
In black and white
But you know girlfriend of mine
If you're doing that right

[repeat]

Get some colours on 
Get some colours on

No i dont care what you dress like
Or what you wear
But please make sure baby 
You've got some colours in there
Now it's all very well stepping out
In black and white
But you know girlfriend of mine
If your doing that right

Get some colours on
Get some colours on
Get some colours on
Get some colours on---Lyrics submitted by Bronte.
