(feat. Ellie Goulding)

Look at what youve done
Stand still
Fallin away from me
When it takes so long
Fires out
What do you want to be?

Im holdin on
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
Theres a power in what you do
Now every other day Ill be watching you

Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Show you what it feels like
Now Im on the outside
Oh-oh
We did everything right
Mow Im on the outside
Oh-oh
Show you what it feels like
Now Im on the outside
Oh-oh
We did everything right
Now Im on the outside

Though you give me no reason
For me to stay close to you
Tell me what lovers do
How are we still breathing?
Its never for us to choose
Ill be the strength in you

Im holdin on
(Im holdin on)
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
Theres a power in what you do
Now every other day Ill be watching you

Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Show you what it feels like
Now Im on the outside
Oh-oh
We did everything right
Mow Im on the outside
Oh-oh
Show you what it feels like
Now Im on the outside
Oh-oh
We did everything right
Now Im on the outside

Ill show you what it feels like
Now Im on the outside
Ill show you what it feels like
Show you what it feels like
Now Im on the outside
We did everything right
Now Im on the outside---
