Im coming round and now my vision is so clear
If I could change my state of mind then I would disappear
The love I get from you is something I cant chance
And I could let you slip away without a second glance

Why cant I realize Im fighting for my life?
Woah Woah!
Why cant I realize Im fighting for my life?
Woah Woah!

This is like a flashback
This is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory x2

This is like a flashback
Flashback
This is like a flashback
Flashback

Why cant I realize Im fighting for my life?
Woah Woah!
Why cant I realize Im fighting for my life?
Woah Woah!

This is like a flashback
This is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory x2---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
