Merrymaking, drug taking,
at my place, baby, at my place
merrymaking,

Come in to my house,
youre invited into my house,
entering the back of my house,
welcoming you into my house,

Ive invited loads to my house,
loads of people come to my house,
they take stuff inside of my house,
and smoke stuff outside of my house,

Merrymaking, drug taking,
at my place, baby, at my place
merrymaking,

Ive seen them before,
lots of people at my front door,
lots of people in my front door,
trying to get into my house,
Ive seen them before,
lots of people in my front door,
lots of people at my front door,
trying to get into my house,

Merrymaking, drug taking,
at my place, baby, at my place
merrymaking,

Were merrymaking,
all the stuff that youve been taking,
all the stuff that ive been taking,
all the stuff that weve been taking,
Were merrymaking, all the stuff that weve been taking,
all the stuff that ive been taking,
all the stuff that youve been taking,

Merrymaking, drug taking,
at my place, baby, at my place---Lyrics submitted by zoe.
