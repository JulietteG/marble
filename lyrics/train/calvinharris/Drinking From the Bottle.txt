(feat. Tinie Tempah)

I,I,I,I compete for everything it's on you
So everything it's on me
Got them girls gone Cindy Lauper got garb and a little blondie
If you ain't drug, then you in the wrong club
No foo sexy, you on the wrong beach
Tell the bartender that we don't want no glass
Just bottles and a plaque everybody want each
Yes so bring the verse clicko
We about to hear the 3.O
Party like it's gonna fall from rio
Life's too short, I need a V.O
Yo, we live, we die, we give, we try, we kiss, we fly
Also we can have a good time

I'm in it busy looking for the next top model
Who's wearing something new and something old
And something borrowed
I know this crazy life can be a bitter pill to swallow
So forget about tomorrow
Tonight, we're drinking from the bottle

[Beat break]

We're drinking from the bottle

[Beat break]

Yo, as long they getting raw then everything is alright
Got the girls going hide, the crew, the kardashians, rihanna, hood tights
If you ain't lean, then you in the wrong scene
If you ain't high, then you not on my vibe
Tell the bartender we don't need to sparkles
And nothing, keep the bottles coming all night
Yes so bring the verse clicko
We about to hear the 3 o
Party like it's gonna fall from rio
Life's too short, I need a vo
Yo, we live, we die, we give, we try, we kiss, we fly
Also we can have a good time

I'm in it busy looking for the next top model
Who's wearing something new and something old
And something borrowed
I know this crazy life can be a bitter pill to swallow
So forget about tomorrow
Tonight, we're drinking from the bottle

[Beat break]

We're drinking from the bottle

[Beat break]

I'm in it busy looking for the next top model
I'm in it busy looking for the next top model
I'm in it busy looking for the next top model
I'm in it busy looking for the next top model
So forget about tomorrow
Tonight,we're drinking from the bottle
We're drinking from the bottle
We're drinking from the bottle... ---
