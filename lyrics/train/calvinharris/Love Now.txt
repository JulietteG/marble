(feat. All About She)

We must bear our souls, souls, souls
Let the fate we fight take hold, hold, hold
Baby, when you come real close, close, close
Its alright 'cause I am whole

'Cause I have been running so long
I wanna love now, I wanna love now, I wanna feel
The weight of this heart that you hold
I wanna love now, I wanna love now, I wanna feel

We can tiptoe round our dreams, dreams, dreams
Just to crash through reality, yeah
I wont spend eternity
Hoping this time Ill be free, free

'Cause I have been running so long
I wanna love now, I wanna love now, I wanna feel
The weight of this heart that you hold
I wanna love now, I wanna love now, I wanna feel

'Cause I have been running too long
I wanna love now, I wanna love now, I wanna feel
The weight of this heart that you hold
I wanna love now, I wanna love now, I wanna feel---
