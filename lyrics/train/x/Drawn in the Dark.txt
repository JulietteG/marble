Nocturnal sweating, drawn in the dark
Men came in the night, men came in the night
It burned her bad, bed, clothes, and sheets
They hide in the reefs, they hide in the reefs
And watched by fire, torn in the dark
He never sleeps, she never sleeps

In where its shallow, where it takes too long
Holdin his hand, now, she takes him downstream

In where its deeper, where it wont take long
Holdin his hand, now, she takes him down

Dark dream, crocodiles, swim in the Nile, swim in the Nile
They come in the light to meet her nightgown
They rest in the reeds, they rest in the reefs
Birds pick their teeth, they go to sleep
While men still search, while men still search---Lyrics submitted by Gary.
