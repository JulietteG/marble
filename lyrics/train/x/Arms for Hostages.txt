Our ships passed in the day
And our stars crossed in the night
Youve said, Paradise, is only far.
Oh, no, we will surely fall.
Dont look, dont look, dont look down

I saw a Hornet and an F-15 Eagle.
I saw a Tomcat fly over the rainbow.
That must mean arms are for hugging.
Wait, dont shoot.  Im only kidding.
Dont look, dont look, dont look down

Shit, it was painful crashing through those branches
When you fall in love you take your chances
I realize that you cant fly, but sometimes I idealize you

Fly         fly
Just hold on to my hand
Please just look into my eyes
Dont look, dont look, dont look down
Dont look, dont look, dont look down---Lyrics submitted by Gary.
