Redneck girl likes to cruise in daddy's pickup truck,
And a redneck girl plays hard when she's down on her luck,
Living for Friday afternoon,
She's gonna show one ol' boy that weekend moon.

And I pray that someday I will find me a redneck girl
A redneck girl likes to stay out all night long
She makes sweet rock and roll while she listens to the country songs
She's waiting for that moment of surrender
Her hands are callused but her heart is tender

And I pray that someday I will find me a redneck girl
Gimme a, gimme a, gimme a redneck girl
Gimme a, gimme a, gimme a redneck girl

Gimme a gimme a gimme a redneck girl
Gimme a gimme a gimme a redneck girl

Redneck girl got her name on the back of her belt
She's got a kiss on her lips for her man and no one else
The Coyote is howling out on the prairie
First comes love, then comes marriage!

And I pray that someday I will find me a redneck girl
Gimme a, gimme a, gimme a redneck girl

Gimme a, gimme a, gimme a redneck girl
You've got to gimme a, gimme a, gimme a redneck girl,
Gimme a gimme a gimme a redneck girl.---Lyrics submitted by Jims Karaoke.
