We write to apologize
We ask to look past life as it goes by
I know you have sacrificed time
life, love, time to fly
Please consider all things trite
Forgiveness will be the thing that gets us by
I know to have something like this
Broken is hard to fix

Embers, we're burning bridges down
Envelopes stuffed with feelings found
To write this down as means to reconcile

We write to patch things up
Maybe not to agree but to proclaim love
Let's look ahead and then we'll see the one
Whose glory never ends
And based on that we'll see
There'll be room for change, but gradually
I know to have something like this
Broken is hard to fix

If all is said and done and over
If we don't have to, we're not going to
Make the change, it's worth the try
What's broken can be fixed tonight.---Lyrics submitted by mitChaeLbOo.
