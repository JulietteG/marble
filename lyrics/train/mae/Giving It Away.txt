And by the way you brought me here, 
it makes me believe the best is still yet to come and I don't want to leave. 
Forgive my hesitation but I'm learning to trust in you. 
Help me to dream these dreams because I don't have a clue.

And if you'd be honest and say what you mean 
you know I would promise I'd do anything 
because I know that without you I'm giving it away.

Is this what you wanted? 
'Cause I'm willing to change. 
Now that I'm certain, 
that there's much more to gain. 
You've introduced me to the moment 
oh but I'm looking to stay for good. 
You asked me to stay forever. 
Well, you know that I would, I would do anything.

And if you'd be honest and say what you mean
you know I would promise I'd do anything
'Cause I know that without you I'm giving it away.

The nights are forever and maybe I'm wrong, 
but it feels like I'm so lost without you. 
So I step towards the heat, it's the way I can see, 
and it makes me believe that it's you.

And by the way you brought me here 
it makes me believe the best is still yet to come and I don't want to leave, 
I won't, but anyway...

If you'd be honest and say what you mean
you know I would promise I'd do anything
And the nights are forever, I can't get to sleep
'Cause I know there's a reason I'm in this too deep 
And I'm sure that without you, I'm giving it away, yeah.

I'm giving it away...---Lyrics submitted by Sara.
