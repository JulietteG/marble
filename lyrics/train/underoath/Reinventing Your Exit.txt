twelve and high 
on a sunday 
feelin like were grown 
and were nothing 
short of invincible (invincible) 

it starts again 
can you feel it? 
it takes your breath away 
stop saying that were invincible 

[pre-chorus 1] 
this round and round 
your uninviting 
unrewarding 
and i'm misinforming you 
misinforming you 

[chorus] 
we don't wanna be 
wanna be somebody 
right now 
were just looking 
for the exit 

[x2] 
this is way I 
would have done this 
up against the wall 
up against the wall 
you've got me up against your wall 

its you and me 
on monday 
the lies that we told 
this is where we both 
go numb now 

[pre-chorus 2] 
you've broke my heart again 
this time, 
you're fading 
now you've crossed the line 
you've crossed the line 

[chorus] 

reaching out for a hand 
its not here 
but your not here 
your not here 

[bridge] 
this is the way 
I would have done this 
up against the wall 
up against your wall 
this is the way 
we should have done 
when were up against our wall 
(up against our wall) 

[x2] 
this is way I 
would have done this 
up against the wall 
up against the wall 
you've got me up against your wall---Lyrics submitted by khay.
