I'm not scared, but this is happening 
I'm not afraid but this is real 
It all comes at once 
From every single direction 
This time I'm not sleeping at all 
How could this be real 
I've failed you, I've failed you
I was lying when I said 
I was looking north 
I was to scared to show what I am 
Bear with me, bear with me this is all I have left 
This might be more than a simple conversation
It's been dancing around in my head for quite some time 
Just the thought of cleaning up myself 
I stare at the wall 
Watching my time float away 
It's all been a blur and nothing will change 
I was lying 
This is defeat---Lyrics submitted by Zach.
