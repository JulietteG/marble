[Verse 1] 
There are so many things that I dont understand 
Theres a world within me that I cannot explain 
Many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same 
I am lost I cant even remember my name 

[Hook] 
Ive been, for sometime, looking for someone 
Fighting to know them 
Please tell me who I am 

[Verse 2] 
Where are the thoughts to try to keep? 
Then I wonder why 

[Hook]---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
