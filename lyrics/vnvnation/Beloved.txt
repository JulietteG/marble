Its colder then before, the seasons took all they had come for
now winter dances here. seem so fitting don't you think, to dress the ground in white an grey
its so quiet i can hear, my thoughts touching every second that i spent waitting for you
circumstances have fought me, no second chance to tell you, how much ive missed you

My beloved do you know, when the warm wind comes again anther year will come to pass
and please don't ask me why im here, something deeper brought me that i need to remember
we were once young an blessed with wings. no height to keep us from their reach 
no secret place we did not soar
still greater things burned within us. i dont regret the choices that ive made i kno you feel the same.

My beloved do you know, how many times i stared at clouds thinking that i saw you there
these are feelings that do not pass so easily. i cant forget what we claimed was ours

Moments lost an time remains, i am so proud of what we were. no pain remains no feeling
eternity awaits grant me wings that i might fly. my restless soul is longing. no pain remains no feeling, eternity awaits

My beloved do you know when the warm wind comes again anther year will start to pass
an please dont ask me why im here something deeper brought me that i need to remember

My beloved do you know how many times i stared at clouds thinking that i saw u there, these are feelings that do not pass so easily i cant forget what we claimed was ours

Moments lost an time remains i am so proud of what we were no pain remains no feeling
eternity awaits, grant me wings that i might fly my restless soul is longing no pain remains no feeling eternity awaits

Moments lost an time remains i am so proud of what we were no pain remains no feeling
eternity awaits, grant me wings that i might fly my restless soul is longing no pain remains no feeling eternity awaits

Moments lost an time remains i am so proud of what we were n paoin remains no feeling 
eternity awaits, grant me wings that i might fly my restless soul is longing no pain remains no feeling eternity awaits.---Lyrics submitted by fey.
