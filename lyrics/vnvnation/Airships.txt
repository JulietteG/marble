i press my face against the glass,
smiled as my breath,
made some pattern or rather, 
world beneath, 
unfollowed before me like a sail,
glinted in cold, 
in this rich dawn sky,
awaiting the ship they had told me would come,
quietly anticipating,
that witch was to come,
i couldn't just sit here,
still obscured by the city,
the towers of glass,
reflection are coming,
silloueted on the sunrise,
did i blink as i watched,
did i close my eyes,
i was not alone,
i think it was the first time,
watching you rise,
splendid and graceful,
i cheered as you sailed,
grateness unknown,
i laughed as i waved,
i imagined you saw me,
streets of the city,
windows of buildings,
a million faces gazing upwards in wonder,
a million faces together and cheering and smiling,
you were the warmth of their hearts,
you were the sum of their dreams,
in the coldness of morning you brought warmth to their lives,
giving this feeeling of wonder,
i could not imagine-you unlocking these thoughts,
no book or no picture could ever convey,
the spearing morning opened the door,
i stepped in to a new world,
i watched you fly,
i saw you as a friend,
the spirit of dreams,
imagined a new world,
lands far away,
and imagined those faces as you hung in the sky,
im leaving ground,
stepping in to a new world,
im leaving ground'
a new world and watching you fly,
i stepped into-i stepped into a new world,
i was not alone,
i think it was the first time,
im leaving ground'
stepping into a new world,
im leaving ground,
stepping into a new world,
now im leaving home- leaving everything-leaving everything
i step into this new world,
leaving everything,
im leaving ground'
stepping into a new world,
im leaving ground,
stepping into a new world,
now im leaving home,
leaving everything that i have ever known,
i step into this new world,
leaving everything,
leaving everything (leaving everything)
leaving everything,---Lyrics submitted by Tim.
