Chorus
I can hear the Master calling, saying come and dine
I can hear the Master calling, saying come and dine
I can hear the Master calling, saying come and dine
Come and dine.Come and dine

He took two fish and five loaves of bread
And the multitude the Lord He fed
Again Hes waiting to feed the multitudes
I can hear Him calling you and you and you

Chorus
At a wedding, He took the water
And turned it into wine, so that all of us could dine
Again Hes waiting, to turn water into wine
It will renew your strength and you might hear the Master
Call and saying..come and dine

Chorus
Come on in and take a seat
From the bread youll surely eat
From the well that wont run dry
You can have a drink of life
If you want a taste of bread
By His word you will be fed
It will give you peace of mind
Why dont you just come and dine

Who so ever will, let Him come---Lyrics submitted by Natisha.
