You are holy, I really love you
In the spirit, I love to worship you

2x: out of all the things I am, everything I hope to be
if you look into my heart, there's a worshiper in me
worshiper in me

2x: You are holy, I really love you
In the spirit, I love to worship you

2x: out of all the things I am, everything I hope to be
if you look into my heart, there's a worshiper in me

6x: The spirit of the Lord is upon me
and the worshiper is in me

3x: out of all the things I am, everything I hope to be
if you look into me heart, there is a worshiper in me
there's a worshiper in me

(Repeat)
I love to worship, I love to worship you---Lyrics submitted by Tanzay.
