Yes you can
Yes you can
Oh yes you can
Yes you can
Yes you can
Oh yes you can
They thought that I'd be weak
But you made me strong
They thought that I would crumble
But they were so wrong.
You held my hand and encourage me to stand
When they said I couldn't do it
I heard you say yes you can
They thought that I'd be weak
But you made me strong
They thought that I would crumble
But they were so wrong.
You held my hand and encourage me to stand
When they said I couldn't do it
I heard you say yes you can
I over came oh
Because you said yes you can
And everyday I'm getting stronger
Because you said yes you can
No longer doubting
Because you said yes you can
So here my time to tell somebody
Cause god said yes you can
I over came oh
Because you said yes you can
And everyday I'm getting stronger
Because you said yes you can
No longer doubting
Because you said yes you can
So it here my time to tell somebody
Cause god said yes you can
So in your life
there will be oppositions---
