So glad I made it,
I made it through
In spite of the storm and rain, heartache and pain
Still Im declaring
That I made it through
See, I didnt lose

Experience lost at a major cost
But I never lost faith in you

So if you see me cry,
Its just a sign that Im
Im still alive
I got some scars, but Im still alive
In spite of calamity,
He still has a plan for me
And its working for my good
And its building my testimony

[Chorus:]
So glad I made it,
I made it through
In spite of the storm and rain, heartache and pain
Im still alive to say
I made it through

I didnt lose
Experienced lost at a major cost,
But I never lost faith in you

Im so glad I made it
So glad I made it
I made it thru
I made it thru

[Chorus: 5 times]
So glad I made it
So glad I made it
I made it thru
I made it thru
Oohh,

So glad I made it
So glad I made it

I made it thru
Ooohhh, so if you see me cry
Its just a sign that Im, Im still alive
I got some scars, but Im still alive
In spite of calamity
He still has a plan for me
Its working out...---Lyrics submitted by andriana.
