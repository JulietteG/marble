Verse 1:
This is not the time for giving up,
this is not your place where you should be,
not the time or the place to lie in defeat,
you got to hold on, you got be strong.

Verse 2:
This is not not the time to question your faith,
this is not your place of destiny,
it's not the time or the place to throw in the towel,
you gotta hold on, you you gotta be strong.

Bridge:
Sometimes you win, 
sometimes you lose,
it's apart of life that everyone goes through.

Sometimes there's joy, 
sometimes there's pain,
that's apart of God's plan, 
it is His own plan.

Chorus:
(This is not the time...),
not the time, not the place,
just believe, keep the faith,
gotta learn how to wait.

(This is not the time...),
not the time, not the place,
just believe, keep the faith,
gotta learn how to wait.

Verse 2

Bridge

Vamp 2:
