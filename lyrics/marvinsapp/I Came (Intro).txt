When I think of the goodness(When I think fo the goodness of Jesus)
And all hes done for me (All hes done for me)
I get excited (I get excited) I gotta reason (I gotta reason to praise!)

Come on get up on your feet (Come on get up on your feet...)
(Praise the Lord with me, everybody come on!)

I can not explain it nor can I contain it
Incredible feeling that's come over me
It makes me claps my hands, run and do my dance
It's over whelming and it's swelling makes me say OOH!
