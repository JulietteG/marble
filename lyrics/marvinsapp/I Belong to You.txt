My healer (healer), ruler (ruler)
Omnipotent (omnipotent) Savior (Savior)
God of now and afore
Youre mine, Im yours
The one I adore, oh

[Chorus]
I belong to you
Youre the reason the skies are blue
No one compares to you
No one can love me like you do
I belong to you
Oh oh oh oh

My healer (healer), ruler (ruler)
Omnipotent (omnipotent) Savior (Savior)
God of now and afore
Youre mine, Im yours
The one I adore, oh

[Chorus]

Youre the reason Im standing here, yes
Secure reason I live and breathe
No one can ever take your place
Could fill this empty space
Thats why I belong to you

[Chorus]

Nothing can separate me from your love, oh
You see, I am yours and you are mine
Ill never leave your side
Now and forever

[Chorus]

I belong, I belong, I belong
I belong to you
I belong, I belong, I belong
Yes, I belong to you
[repeat to end]---Lyrics submitted by Janice McCullou.
