My soul is thirsty
My soul is thirsty for you(2x)

As the deer is thirsty for the water
So does my soul long for thee
My spirit needs refreshing
Father I'm thirsty
Thirsty for you

My soul is thirsty
My soul is thirsty for you(2x)

As the deer is thirsty for the water
So does my soul long for thee
My spirit needs refreshing
Father I'm thirsty
Thirsty for you

(Lead) Let me drink from the fountain
that never shall run dry
the fountain of everlasting life

(Choir) for if i drink of your water i will never thirst again
Let me draw from your living well

My soul is thirsty
My soul is thirsty for you (2x)

As the deer is thirsty for the water
So does my soul long for thee
My spirit needs refreshing
Father I'm thirsty (5x)
Thirsty for you

I am thirsty
oh-o oh-o (8x)

Reprise:

(Lead) I need thee oh, I need thee.
Evey hour, I need thee
Oh Bless, me now my Savior
Im thristy, Im thirsty for you

I am thirsty
oh-o oh-o (10x)

Repeat

I am...oh-o, oh-o (11x)---Lyrics submitted by Eunique.
