my life is a testimony
my heart is an open vessel
my will is the works that yeilds to your will
my walk is the way you lead
my talk is the words you feed
my praise is the sweetest sound to your ears.

hallelujah,hallelujah,hallelujah
we worship you we worship you today (2x)

i live cause you have allowed 
i give cause you showed me how 
im here as a testimony unto you
there's no place id rather be
there's no other god for me
there's no other name i give all the praise

hallelujah,hallelujah,hallelujah
we worship you we worship you today (2x)---Lyrics submitted by Diamond.
