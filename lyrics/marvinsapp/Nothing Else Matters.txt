Verse 1:
So many pressures in life
and so many reasons to throw in the towel,
but when I feel like I'm losing this fight,
consolation from heaven comes clearly to me
to remind me (to remind me)
to remind me (to remind me) 
that...

Chorus 1:
Nothing else matters
than seeing You, Jesus.
Seeking the Master,
the One who reigns over my life.

Nothing else matters
than seeing You, Jesus.
Just to sit at Your feet,
hear Your voice clearly speak,
lifts me out of defeat,
for in You I'm complete;
it reminds me that nothing else,
nothing else matters.

Verse 2
So many rivers to cross
and there's so many mountains discouraging you;
just don't focus on yesterday's lost,
consolation from heaven
will come clearly to you.

Consolation from the Father,
it will come to you.
Consolation from the Father,
it will come to you
to remind you (to remind you),
to remind you (to remind you) that...

Chorus 1

Bridge:
Broken before You,
I need to receive a fresh touch from heaven,
and I will not leave 'til You touch me, 
oh Lord, I pray.

I need You every day
with all of my heart, I believe
that You're all I ever want,
You're all I ever need.

Chorus 2:
(Nothing else matters), no, nothing,
(than seeing You, Jesus)
than seeing You, Jesus, yeah.

(Seeking the Mater)
(seeking the Master),
(the One who reigns over my life).

No, (nothing else matters)
no, nothing,
(than seeing You, Jesus)
than seeing You, Jesus, yeah...

Vamp 1:
Just to sit at Your feet,
hear Your voice clearly speak,
lifts me out of defeat,
for in You I'm complete.

Vamp 2:
No, nothing,
nothing even matters at all.---Lyrics submitted by Tanzay.
