I can't feel this way much longer 
expecting to survive 
with all these hidden innuendoes 
just waiting to arrive 
it's such a wavy midnight 
and you slip into insane 
electric angel rock and roller 
I hear what you're playin' 

it's an orangy sky 
always it's some other guy 
it's just a broken lullaby 
bye bye love 
bye bye love 
bye bye love 
bye bye love 

substitution mass confusion 
clouds inside your head 
involving all my energies 
until you visited 
with your eyes of porcelain and of blue 
they shock me into sense 
you think you're so illustrious 
you call yourself intense 

it's an orangy sky 
always it's some other guy 
it's just a broken lullaby 
bye bye love 
bye g-bye love 
yeah bye bye love 
bye bye love-ov-ov-ove 

substitution mass confusion 
clouds inside your head 
were foggin' all my energies 
until you visited 
with your eyes of porcelain and of blue 
they shock me into sense 
you think you're so illustrious 
you call yourself intense 

it's an orangy sky 
always it's some other guy 
it's just a broken lullaby 
bye bye love 
bye bye love 
bye bye love 
bye bye love---Lyrics submitted by Lori.
