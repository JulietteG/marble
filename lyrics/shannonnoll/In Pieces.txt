Your in my air
Every breathe that i take i can't escape
Ohhh everywhere I go
I feel your stare like your there
Can't you see i'm scattered
Like memories from the past
Shattered like a bullet through glass

Chorus:
I'm in pieces
On what might've been
Every night i spend asleep less
Smokin' cigarettes till 3am
In an empty bed and I can't get you out of my head

You burnt your name
Into my heart where it's scared
I can't erase you from me
You soul and mine intertwined
You cut the line
And i'm drifting
Holdin' to the past
Memories like a bullet through glass

Chorus:
I'm in pieces
On what might've been
Every night I spend asleep less
Smokin' cigarettes till 3am
In an empty bed and i can't get you out of my head

Oh I can't get you out of my head
Outta my head
Outta my life
Outta my dream
Broken emotion you left me in pieces
Scattered like memories from the past
Shattered like a bullet through glass

Chorus:
I'm in pieces
Ohhh what might've been
Every night I spend asleep less
Smokin' cigarettes till 3am
In an empty bed and I can't get you out of my head

No I can't get you outta my head
Outta my head x9---Lyrics submitted by Tracy.
