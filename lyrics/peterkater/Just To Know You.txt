Just to know you
Just to live inside your grace
Just to feel you
In my heart, at this time, in this place

There is peace in every breath
As my mind dwells on your name
Finding peace, peace within
Treasure of bliss, never ends

Saas Saas man naam Man naam samaarai. Eho bisaraam nid paa-ee

(Translation: With each and every breath my mind remembers the Naam, the Name of the Lord. In this way it finds the treasure of bliss.)---Lyrics submitted by Kali Priya.
