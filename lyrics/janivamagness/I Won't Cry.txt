The harder the words, the colder the night
The closer the hand, the sharper the knife
The longer you hold out
The further you seem to fly
I get cut and I might bleed
But I wont cry!

The bigger the love, the blacker the birds
Unless they can give
The more I could use
The longer you hold out
The further you seem to fly
I get cut and I might bleed
But I wont cry!

The quicker the lie
(I might bleed)
The softer the moan
(I might bleed)
All of those whisper
(I might bleed)
They just sink like a stone

(I might bleed)
I think momma should push on
(I might bleed)
Before those  just fly
I get cut and I might bleed
But I wont cry!

The stronger the bond, oh, oh
The tougher the loss, oh, oh
The pain in my heart, oh, oh
Until it just stops
Once more Ill just hold on
Until I get strength to fly
I get cut and I might bleed
But I wont cry!
I get cut and I might bleed
But I wont cry!
I get cut and I might bleed
But I wont cry!
I get cut and I might bleed
But I wont cry! ---
