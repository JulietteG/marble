There it is, there it is

I'll never fall
I wanna heard a man so bad but baby
There it is,
(there it is, there it is)
Eyes wide open i shot them my friend
I ain't lying
There it is,
(there it is, there it is)

You should have thought for a moment or two
Before you made a fool out of me
I guess i ain't the right kind of woman
For the man you turn how to be
I'll go madly with those tired excuses
That don't mean nothing to me
They don't mean nothing

I never thought
I wanna heard a man so bad but baby
There it is,
(there it is, there it is)
Tuff of mistakes maybe one little shot
I ain't sorry, there it is

Don't you come back and here like a cry little baby
And a ..Here
Long ago you had the charm to put on
But those ..Long since disappear

Don't come around here with those turn excuses
They don't mean nothing to me,
They don't mean nothing

I'll never fall
I wanna heard a man so bad but baby
There it is,
(there it is, there it is)
Just a little something extra in a coming coffee
I'm just sayin there it is,
(there it is, there it is)

Well

Now i've had just a..Any woman can stand
I just watch you drive off with the tear in my eye
And is reaching my hair
Bye bye

I'll never fall
I wanna heard a man so bad but baby
There it is,
(there it is, there it is)
Eyes wide open i shot them my..
I aint' lying there it is
(there it is, there it is)
No i ain't sorry, i aint' sorry
There it is, (there it is, there it is)
Yeah, i aint' sorry
No no no
There it is ---
