Oooh Lord

I knew from the very beginning, what you had in mind,
But I said to myself baby, youre gonna just be wastin' your time.
But somehow during the night, things got out of hand,
Before I knew it baby, I was giving my love away again.

You know, I slipped, tripped, fell in love, when you slipped your love on me. Mmm mmmm
Slipped, tripped, fell in love, when you slipped your love on me.  Oooh Lord

Now getting hooked on you baby, was the last thing on my mind,
Now you got me wanting you baby, want you all the time.
When you touch me, I just lose control,
Found myself, baby, wantin' more, more, more.  Oooh Lord

Slipped, tripped, fell in love, when you slipped your love on me.    Oooh Lord 
Slipped, tripped, fell in love, when you slipped your love on me.  I aint worried bout it.  Mmnt mmnt

When you touch me, I just lose control,
Im finding myself baby, wantin' more, more, more.   Ooh woow

Slipped, tripped, fell in love, when you slipped your love on me.    Oooh Hooo 
Slipped, tripped, fell in love, when you slipped your love on me.  Oh yeah
Slipped, tripped, fell in love, when you slipped your love on me.  I aint worried bout it.  No no
Slipped, tripped, fell in love, when you slipped your love on me.  Oh yeah
Slipped, tripped, fell in love.  I know you did
Slipped, tripped, fell in love  I aint worried bout it.  No no
Slipped, tripped, fell in love.  Oh yeah
Slipped, tripped, fell in love.  Oh Hooo---Lyrics submitted by Sherry Paul.
