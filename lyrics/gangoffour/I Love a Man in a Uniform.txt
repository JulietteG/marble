Time with my girl i spent it well
I had to be strong for my woman
(you must be joking, o man you must be joking)
She needed to be protected

The good life was so elusive
Handouts, they got me down
I had to regain my self-respect
So i got into camouflage

The girls they love to see you shoot

I love a man in a uniform
I love a man in a uniform
I love a man in a uniform
I love a man in a uniform

To have ambitions was my ambition
But i had nothing to show for my dreams
Time with my girl i spent it well
(you must be joking, o man you must be joking)

The good life was so elusive
Handouts, they got me down
I had to regain my confidence
So i got into camouflage

The girls they love to see you shoot

I love a man in a uniform
I love a man in a uniform
I love a man in a uniform
I love a man in a uniform

I need an order
(shoot, shoot)
I need an order
(shoot, shoot)
I need an order
(shoot, shoot)
I need an order
(shoot, shoot)

To have ambition

Was my ambition
Time with my girl i spent it well
(you must be joking, o man you must be joking)

The girls they love to see you shoot
The girls they love to see you shoot

I love a man in a uniform
I love a man in a uniform
(they love to see you shoot)
I love a man in a uniform

The girls they love to see you shoot
I love a man in a uniform
(they love to see you shoot)

The girls they love to see you shoot
I love a man in a uniform
(they love a... they love a... they love a...)
(they love to see you shoot)

The girls they love to see you shoot
(bang bang you're dead)
I love a man in a uniform
(they love a... they love a... they love a... bang bang)
(they love to see you shoot)

The girls they love to see you shoot
I love a man in a uniform
(they love a... they love a... they love a... bang bang)
(they love to see you shoot)

The girls they love to see you shoot
(bang bang you're dead)
I love a man in a uniform
(they love a... they love a... they love a... bang bang)
(they love to see you shoot)

The girls they love to see you shoot
(bang bang you're dead)
(they love a... they love a... they love a...)
(i love a man in a uniform)---Lyrics submitted by Christine.
