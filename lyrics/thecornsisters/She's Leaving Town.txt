Well my old car gave up on the side of the road
the radiator let out a sigh
as I stood there steaming as the traffic rolled by
I looked on as you passed me by

well I hitched up my pants and I rode into town
there's nothing else that I could do
the sun hurt my eyes as the traffic rolled by
the bus stop, and it picked up you

chorus...

she's leaving town, she's leaving town
and I never will see her again
she's going start her a brand new life
gonna sit down and wait for my own life to end

whistle medley of chorus

well I see that a man makes his own luck in life 
but you got to have faith in the lord
I just wanted some one to sing me to sleep
when I tired and done all my chores

she's leaving town, she's leaving town
and I never will see her again
she's going start her a brand new life
gonna sit down and wait for my own life to end

well I see that a man makes his own luck in life 
but you got to have faith in the lord
I just wanted some one to sing me to sleep
when I tired and done all my chores
when I tired and done all my chores

whooo.....---Lyrics submitted by Allison.
