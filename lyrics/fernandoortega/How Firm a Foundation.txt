How firm a foundation ye saints of the Lord, 
Is laid for your faith in His excellent word. 
What more can he say, than to you he hath said; 
To you, who for refuge to Jesus have fled? 

Fear not, I am with thee, oh be not dismayed 
For I am thy God, and will still give thee aid. 
I strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand, 
Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand. 

When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie, 
My grace all-sufficient shall be thy supply. 
The flame shall not hurt thee, I only design 
Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine. 

The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose, 
I will not, I will not desert to His foes. 
That soul, though all Hell should endeavor to shake 
I'll never, no never, no never forsake.---
