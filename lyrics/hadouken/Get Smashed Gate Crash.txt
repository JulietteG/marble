Lets get this party started!

Get smashed, gate crash!
Get smashed, gate crash!

Friday night and we just arrived,
theres a fair few girls but mostly guys,
got supplies now we in the drive,
I hope we got the house number right.

Knock loud and ring the bell,
door swings and the music swells out,
its quite catchy if you could tell,
in the hall welcome to hell.

Welcome to our world,
we are the wasted youth,
and we are the future too.
Welcome to our world,
we are the wasted youth,
and we are the future.

lets get this party started
and rip the place apart.
cut the brakes, text your mates
lets tear this house apart

Were drinking, screaming, shagging,
we dont care what we doing,
dont care when they come back,
our parents will be screwing.

People being sick on the landing carpet,
smoking up in the outside shed,
passing out in the upstairs toilet,
getting laid on the parents bed.

Smashing up all the porcelain china,
we drank the alcohol cabinet clean,
but still that felt minor,
till we put the hi-fi through the tv screen.

Welcome to our world,
we are the wasted youth,
and we are the future too.
Welcome to our world,
we are the wasted youth,
and we are the future.

We feel so damn invincible.
We are not responsible.

Get smashed, gate crash!
Get smashed, gate crash!
Get smashed, gate crash!

She will be sick on the landing carpet,
smoking up in the outside shed,
passing out in the upstairs toilet,
getting laid on the parents bed.

Smashing up all the porcelain china,
we drank the alcohol cabinet clean,
but still that felt minor,
till we put the hi-fi through the tv screen---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
