Hart in my mouth, but my head in the clouds yeah
I can feel it rising
Bound to the Earth but, we could ascend yeah
Im realizing

I feel both feet lift off the ground
I can levitate
With every chord that plays I close my eyes
And levitate

I can float
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The air is electric, the higher the scent is(?)
I can feel it charging
Ill never forget you with transcending
I dont know we started

I feel both feet lift off the ground
I can levitate
With every truth that leaves I close my eyes
And levitate
I levitate

Hart in my mouth, but my head in the clouds yeah
I can feel it rising
Bound to the Earth but, we could ascend yeah
Im realizing

I feel both feet lift off the ground
I can levitate
With every chord that plays I close my eyes
And levitate

I can float
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I can levitate
I can levitate

I feel both feet lift off the ground
I can levitate
With every chord that plays I close my eyes
And levitate
I levitate---Lyrics submitted by Ian S. Cuneo.
