Being young and feeling high
We will never ever come down
Being high and feeling young
We will never ever come down
They will try with all their might
They can't buy what we have tonight
Fall in fall in fall in love
We will never ever come down

So young, so high
So young, so high
So young, so high
So young, so high [x3]

Being young and feeling high
We will never ever come down
Being high and feeling young
We will never ever come down
They will try with all their might
They cant buy what we have tonight
Fall in fall in fall in love
We will never ever come down

So young, so high
So young, so high
So young, so high
So young, so high---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
