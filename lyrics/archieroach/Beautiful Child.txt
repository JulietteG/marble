oh my beautiful child 
my beautiful child 
the brightest of stars
couldn't match us with smiles

but he grew up too soon
from beyond your young years 
now all that reminds   
is your memory indeed

you were always divine
and they put you through hound\hell
and they locked you away
in a dark lonely cell
but you weren't really bad (bade)
just a little bit wild
now they'll hound you no more
oh my beautiful child

dun dun din dun dun ohhhohhhohh 

beautiful beautiful child
now you are free
free from this heart aching pain and mesuree (mes-ooh-rhee)
we're never no more body that day
some said you smile

and  i wish i was with you right now
my beautiful child
you've been locked up before
but you've always came back
with your hands held high
and so be prepped to be glad

but the last time they came
how could i have known
when they took you away
that you never come home

yet they pushed you around
but his skin wasn't white
and although you were gentle
you learn't how to fight
and you fought all your life
no you didn't fail
but you deserve better
than to die on someday

ooh 
beautiful beautiful child
now you oh free
free from this heart aching pain and mes-oooh-rheeeee
we're never no more body that day
some  said you smarrr

and  i wish i was with you right now
my beautiful child
and i wish i was with you right now
my beautiful child---Lyrics submitted by Jonathan.
