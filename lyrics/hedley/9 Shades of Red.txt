where did i go so wrong
singing the same sad song
sittin' home all a lone saying woe is me
LA LA LA LA LA LA LA

so now im calling all of my friends 
and this is where the fun begins
what it would take to avoid a little break from the boreddome little
HA HA HA HA
holler back for a planned attack on this unsespecting town
we may be looking pretty, but we make an awful sound

[chorus] i'ts you and its me and thats all that we'll ever need
and yah we'll tear up the streets and we'll dance until we bleed
and then we'll sleep when were dead cause we'll take over this town 
and paint it nine shades of red, getting down is what were up to tonight

And now the security is having a fit
cause nobody is givin us a shi*
and as the party gets cloudy yeah we start to get rowdy 
screaming RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH
and if we gotta deal with the cops
thy to shut us up and say the fun stops
god we gotta keep grooving while your mouth keeps moving Mr.
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH

holler back for a planned attack on this unsespecting town
we may be looking pretty but we make an awful sound
[chorus]

so now we gotta get up and shout
until everybody kicks us out
or till the lights come on and all the fights go on
i'ts everything that were all about
so now we got to get up and shout
until everybody kicks us out
or till the lights go on and all the fights go on
i'ts what were all about
[chorus]
(x2)
