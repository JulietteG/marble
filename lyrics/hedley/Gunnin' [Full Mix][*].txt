Tell me what Ill never be
make me feel broken
and tell me what I should believe
I didnt know we was broken

And Im gunin for you
Im gunnin for you
And I will wait
Ill write another letter to myself
And I will find out that morning comes faster alone

I hate the way you look at me
as if I was broken
the perfection of my frailty has been questioned and broken

And Im gunnin for you
Im gunnin for you
And I will wait
Ill write another letter to myself
And I will find out that morning comes faster alone

And I feel like Im fine today
I feel like im ready to change this time
And Ill fight you to the great fallen
Ill never let you take a part of me with you

And I will wait 
Ill write another letter to myself
And I will find out that morning comes faster alone
And I will wait
Ill write another letter to myself uhhuh
And I will find out that morning comes faster alone

The perfection of my frailty has been questioned and brokennnn---Lyrics submitted by Lindsey.
