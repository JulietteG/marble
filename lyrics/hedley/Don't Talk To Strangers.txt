She was a bottle blond,
She had her 7's on.
When I think about it now,
just a cougar on the prowl.
She was hotter than hell,
had me under her spell.
Got that ass too in yoga,
didn't care that she's older.

Got off the stage,
ended up at her place.
We were burning up the bed,
fire need to be fed.
Morning sun hit her face,
Maggie May showed her age.
I remembered when my momma said;


Chorus
Don't talk to Strangers
Don't do all the thinking with your little head.
Like mama said, just like mama said, my mama said:
Don't talk to strangers,
Just wrap it up so you don't wind up dead.
Like mama said, just like mama said.
My mama said.

She like them nice and young,
She likes them fresh and hungry.
With fire n her eyes,
let's you try her on for size.
Show you a trick or two,
to teach you something now.
Full of Bacardi and Botox, 
She's forty and so hot.

The light of the day
] had something different to say.
My head started to spin
 when I saw her son walking in.
I'll bet he felt like a fool, 
cause I knew him from school.
I remembered when my mama said;

Chorus
Don't talk to Strangers
Don't do all the thinking with your little head.
Like mama said, just like mama said, my mama said:
Don't talk to strangers,
Just wrap it up so you don't wind up dead.
Like mama said, just like mama said.
My mama said.

Hey pretty lady, It's crazy.
You're almost twice my age.
I want to dance on your body
the way i shake it on stage

Hey pretty lady, It's crazy.
You're almost twice my age.
I want to dance on your body
the way i shake it on stage

Hey pretty lady, It's crazy.
You're almost twice my age.
I want to dance on your body
the way i shake it on stage

Hey pretty lady, It's crazy.
You're almost twice my age.
I want to dance on your body
the way i shake it on stage

Don't talk to strangers, 
don't do all the thinking with your little head
(Like mama said, like mama said, like mama said)
Don't talk to strangers,
Don't do all the thinking with your little head
Like mama said, just like mama said.
my mama said
Don't talk to strangers,
just wrap it up so you don't wind up dead.
Like mama said, just like mama said. 
my mama said.---Lyrics submitted by michelle.
