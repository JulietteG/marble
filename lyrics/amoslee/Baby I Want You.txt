Baby I want you
Baby I want you
Baby I do
Darlin I love you
Darlin I love you
You know that its true

Dont leave me here out on my own
Dont you know how I hate to be alone
I just wanna be part of your home

Baby I want you
Baby I want you
Baby I do
Darlin I love you
Darlin I love you
You know that its true

Dont leave me here out in the cold
Dont you know its your hand I wanna hold
As these days fly past and unfold, hey

Baby I want you
Baby I want you
Baby I do
Darlin I love you
Darlin I love you
You know that its true---Lyrics submitted by Laura.
