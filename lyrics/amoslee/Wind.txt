Saturday night, my head is spinning.
I wonder who's heart I've been sinning for.

Cold rain blows on my window.
Soft sand gone from my pillow.

One more step that I've been taking,
Yes and one more,
I don't need no more breaking up.

All the red lights, how they are
Burning down the highway.

I remember when the wind
Had blown my way.

But the wind blew down my line.
Yeah, the wind, blew down my line.

Man on the street, each day I'm passing.
A small bite to eat is all he's been asking for.

Oh, but cold stares is all he's been yielding.
Oh, and now I know that empty feeling.

Yeah, the wind blew down my line
Yeah, the wind blew down my line.
Yeah, the wind blew down my line ---Lyrics submitted by Tom.
