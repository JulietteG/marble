Well I walked over the bridge
Into the city where I live
And I saw my old landlord
Well we both said hello
There was nowhere else to go
Cause his rent I couldnt afford

Well relationships change
Though I think its kind of strange
How money makes a man grow
Oh some people they claim
If you get enough fame
You live over the rainbow
Over the rainbow...

But the people on the street
Out on buses, out on feet
We all got the same blood flow
Oh, in society every dollar got a deed
We all need a place where we can go
And feel over the rainbow...

Sometimes we forget what we got
Who we are
And who we are not
I think we got a chance
To make it right
Keep it loose, keep it tight
Keep it tight

Im in love with a girl
Whos in love with the world
Though I cant help but follow
Though I know someday
She is bound to go away
And stay over the rainbow
Gotta learn how to let her go
Over the rainbow

Sometimes we forget who we got
Who they are
Oh who they are not
There is so much more in love
Than black and white
Keep it loose, child, gotta keep it tight
Keep it loose, child, keep it tight
Keep it tight
Keep it tight
Keep it tight, yeah---Lyrics submitted by Laura.
