Lately I, Ive been headed for a breakdown
Every time I leave my house well it feels just like a shakedown 
Between the street sweepers and the pushers 
Or the lawyers who may as well be butchers
Between the small timin hustlers who all seem to feed upon each other  

Oh God, why you been hangin out in that old violin
While Ive been waiting for you to pull me through

Lately I, every time I try to lie down
Well my mind just gets away
I cant even close my eyes now
Between the big fisher ambition
And the lovers using words as ammunition
Between the wood planks Ive been pacin 
And this impossible dream that Ive been chasin

Oh God why you been hangin out in that old violin
While Ive been waiting for you to pull me through

Oh God
Oh God
Oh God why you been hangin out in that old violin
While Ive been waiting for you to pull me through
Oh God
Oh God
Oh God---Lyrics submitted by Maria.
