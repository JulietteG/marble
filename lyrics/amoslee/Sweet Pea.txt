sweet pea
apple of my eye
dont know when
and i dont know why

your the only reason
i keep on commin
home

sweet pea
whats all this about
dont get your way 
all you do is fuss and pout

your the only reason
i keep on commin
home

im like the rock of the Gibralter
i always seem to falter
and the words just get in the way

oh i know im gonna crumble
im tryin to stay humble
but i never think before i say....

(intrumental break)

sweet pea
keeper of my soul
i know sometimes 
im out of control

your the only reason 
i keep on commin

your the only reason
i keep on commin yeah

your the only reason
i keep on commin
home---Lyrics submitted by casey.
