Hey baby
Its all great 
We all do what we gotta do
Hey darlin 
Im broken hearted
Ive been cryin for my cryins due

And Ive learned a lot, Ive really learned a lot 
Broken down on my bedroom floor
Yes I learned a lot, Ive really learned a lot 
I hope you found what you were looking for

Spent a lot of time starin at the ceiling 
Spent a lot of time talkin to walls
Spent a lot of time chasin that old time feeling 
Spent a lot of time waitin on your call 

And I learned a lot, Ive really learned a lot
Broken down on my bedroom floor
Yes I learned a lot, Ive really learned a lot 
I hope you found what you were looking for

Oh and darlin the sun has been fallin
Like the dust on some mid western plane
Oh and darlin instead of runnin
I think it might be time you sit down and deal with the pain

Late at night I sit and listen to the freeway
Rollin like a river on a distant shore
Nobody told me that livin was easy 
I aint livin in fear anymore 

And I learned a lot, Ive really learned a lot
Broken down on my bedroom floor
Yes I learned a lot, Ive really learned a lot 
I hope you found what you were looking for
I hope you found what you were looking for---Lyrics submitted by Maria.
