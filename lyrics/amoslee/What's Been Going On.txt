No one says a word to me
They're concerned with my jealousy
Well I guess that's how it's gotta be
From now on

Time it swallows everything
From the mighty to the meager thing
It's as dark as it is comforting
To play along

What's been going on
What's been going on
What's been going on
Around here?

There goes her old beat up car
Outside of our favorite bar
She's probably in there
Playing her guitar
With stars in her eyes

Those are some of my favorite memories
All those carefree melodies
While I'm out here on this raging sea
About to capsize

Well what's been going on
What's been going on
What's been going on
Around here?

What's been going on
What's been going on
What's been going on
Around here?

No one says a word to me
They're concerned with my jealousy
I guess that's how it's gotta be
From now on---Lyrics submitted by Laura.
