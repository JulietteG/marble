I am at ease in the arms of a woman
Although now most of my days are spent alone
A thousand miles from the place I was born
But when she wakes me she takes me back home

Now most days I spend like a child
Whos afraid of ghosts in the night
I know there aint nothing out there
But Im still afraid to turn on the light

I am at ease in the arms of a woman
Although now most of my days are spent alone
A thousand miles from the place I was born
But when she wakes me she takes me back home

A thousand miles from the place I was born
But when she wakes me she takes me back home

I am at ease in the arms of a woman
Although now most of my days are spent alone
A thousand miles from the place I was born
But when she wakes me she takes me 
Yeah, when she wakes me she takes me 
Yeah, when she wakes me she takes me back home

When she wakes me she takes me back home---Lyrics submitted by Maria.
