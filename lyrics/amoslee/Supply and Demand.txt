Somethin' gotta give with the way I'm livin'
Seems I'm gettin' down everyday
The more I strive, the less I'm alive
And it seems I'm gettin' further away

Oh well, all my superstitions
And my crazy suspicions
Of the people that I care about

I've been doin' more screamin'
Than I've been doin' dreamin'
And I think it's time I figured it out

Yeah, baby I need a plan, oh, to understand
That life ain't only supply and demand

I've been goin' joggin' in the park after dark
Draggin' 'round with me my ball and chain
Took southern skies to make me realize
That I'm causin' myself this pain

Well, the woman that I'm lovin'
Yeah, I'm pushin' and shovin'
Getting further on by the day

And I can't understand
How the heart of this man
Ever let it end up this way

Baby, I need a plan, oh, to understand
That life ain't only supply and demand

When the road gets dark and lonesome, dear
You can find me here
But honey, you don't know where I am
You need a friend, yeah

Life ain't easy, in fact I know it's sleazy
When you're the big man in town
Shakin' religions and makin' decisions
You never get to slow on down

Well, your wife and your baby
You tell them, "Yeah, well maybe
I'll meet y'all at a weekend resort"

But your eye's on the prize
And you can't realize
That your little girl's life's so short

Brother, you need a plan, oh, to understand
That life ain't only supply and demand

Yeah, sister you need a plan, oh, to understand 
That life ain't only supply and demand

Hey, you better figure it out now
You know you ain't comin' back down, yeah
You better figure it out now
You know you ain't comin' back down---Lyrics submitted by Thomas.
