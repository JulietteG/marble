He got a new mercy
A new grace
Street corner preacher
With the angry face
He got 2 years off 
For good behavior
Back in the neighborhood, workin for the Savior

Theres two old ladies
And a junkie  na na
He can see for sure that his work is cut out
Though he walks through the shadows
He wont fear his neighbor
Back in the neighborhood workin for the Savior

Ba ba 
Budie du pa bud it in
Ba ba 
Budie du pa bud it in
Ba ba 
Budie du pa bud it in
Ba ba 
Yeah yeah

Well he understands the need for livin large
But its hard to get a job with a felony charge
Now hes workin in a hospital 
Washin dishes
Walkin through the fields
Through the lost and the viscious
There he saves every breath
A new benediction
Save the liver from awkening
xxx
The eyes of man
Well he seeks no favor
Back in the neighborhood workin for the Savior

But theres a whole lotta trouble all around
Every night the same old siren sound
Theres a whole lotta trouble all around
Children soldiers in this battleground

Bud it in
Ba ba 
Budie du pa bud it in
Ba ba 
Budie du pa bud it in
Ba ba 
Yeah yeah

With a new shine
And a second chance
He unbolts the door 
And hops over the fence
Young woman with a baby that her daddy gave her
Back in the neighborhood workin for the Savior

But all around the world rages on
Burnt-out houses
With the front door gone
Well his faith is his fountain
His love is his neighbor
Back in the neighborhood workin for the Savior


Whooa yeah
Ahhhh
Ba ba
Budie du pa bud it in
Ba ba 
Budie du pa bud it in
Ba ba 
Budie du pa bud it in
Ba ba 
Yeah yeah

He got a new mercy
A new grace
Street corner preacher
With the angry face
He got 2 years off 
For good behavior
Back in the neighborhood, workin for the Savior---Lyrics submitted by gail.
