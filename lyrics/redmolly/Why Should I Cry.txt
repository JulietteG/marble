Mark erelli                                    why should i cry
You taught me everything i know  about being lonesome
And i learned my lessons oh so faithfully
What was i thinking of     when i gave you my love
For i knew you would go eventually

You can't say      he never gave you nothing
Afterall he left you with the blues
It ain't much      but at least it's something
I don't believe that i will ever lose

Tell me why should i cry over you  sweet darling
Why should i cry over you
Give me one good reason i should be with you 
Why should i cry over you

Break

I'm all through feeling blue for you my darling
I know           you would do the same for me
You're gonna walk right out the door
Gonna even up the score
Oh two can play that game so easily
I don't expect you will ever come  a'calling
But should we chance to me out on the avenue
Don't be surprised when you don't see teardrops falling
Honey why should i cry over you

Tell me why should i cry over you  sweet darling
Why should i cry over you
Give me one good reason i should be with you 
Why should i cry over you
Won't ya give me one more reason i should be with you
Why should i cry over you---Lyrics submitted by RON GALL.
