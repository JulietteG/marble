It's the last call, for the broken hearted
It's the last call, for to save your soul. 
It won't take you no money, it won't take no Jesus,
a little faith and love and you'll be made whole.

Well I spent a year in the darkest of daydreams, 
Fighting off the demons I created myself.
Try and fix what was never really broken, 
Living a lie like I was somebody else 

When I finally let go I found everything I needed, 
Shining in the eyes of the one I love. 
Now I see that we're all something of a tragic hero, 
Flailing and flying for the clouds up above.

It's the last call, for the broken hearted.
It's the last call, for to save your soul. 
It won't take you no money, it won't take no Jesus,
a little faith and love and you'll be made whole.

I believe theres a companion, for every compadre,
Every lonely desperado and a band of gold.
OK, forget the gold, hows about a painted pony?
To take you and your love straight from here to Mexico.

It's the last call, for the broken hearted
It's the last call, for to save your soul. 
It won't take you no money, it won't take no Jesus, 
a little faith and love and you'll be made whole.

It's the last call, for the broken hearted
It's the last call, for to save your soul. 
It won't take you no money, it won't take no Jesus,  
a little faith and love and you'll be made whole.
Yeah, just a little faith and love and you'll be made whole.
