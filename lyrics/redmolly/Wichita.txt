GILLIAN WELCH                                          Wichita
She went back to Wichita
She went back to her ma and pa
Reckon I saw her next to my truck
Pumping gas with the car packed up.
We talked as neighbors will
There waiting for the tanks to fill
We talked about nothing
how it might snow
How far she had to go.
Going back where the grass grows tall
And the fields burn in the fall
You can still hear the night birds call
Back in Wichita.
She came in '85
She came here as a July bride
But it never got easy
never got rich
Ain't got much but what she came here with.
Good times have all been spent
She ain't broken but she's badly bent
There's nothing she wants here
nothing that shines
She's made up her mind.
She says for all my time
well I ain't got much to show
You can tell that man of mine and anyone who wants to know
Going back where the grass grows tall
And the fields burn in the fall
You can still hear the night birds call
Back in Wichita.---Lyrics submitted by RON GALL.
