I fell into a cinema
Watching pictures in a dream
Shifting the fidget into still
Nine other people took their leave

No humping bones or filigree
Grace and nature mimicry 
All but took me to my knees...

(Chorus)
You jump too soon
And miss all this 
Now something beautiful happens
All there is this beautiful meetings
We wait on, we wait on

It moved as slow as slow can be
Half eaten words of earth and sea
I didn't feel it touching me...

[Chorus]

I fell into a cinema
I didn't know where else to be
Sitting out a trip or three
I thought I want frippery
Fat girl five seats down and me
Concave and blinking at the scene
Rolling credits on the screen...

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Josef Griffiths.
