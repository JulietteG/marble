Chevy ridin high
24's still wet
Dis a diamond chain baby
No golds on the neck
I rose from da set
Call me Yung Fresh
Prince of the Chi
Who's fuckin with I
And they be like
There he go
Ooh I seen him on the T.V
I chunk them off the duces
And I tell 'em just be easy
I'm stuntin when u see me
The money's all around me
And if I aint rollin
Then im finna pop a breezy
(go)Take off light skinned
Then im goin to the next one
Hit that girl twice
And I treat her like a step-son
Pimpin you aint like me
Im a professional
They say Im sensational
Dawg when im sexin' em
Wanna be like me
Dis is wat u better do
Eat ur scooby snacks
And clear a whole plate of vegetables
But still popeye's spinach ya kno
Cant stop ya girl from hangin up thats on the wall

(chorus x2)
Do that there
How ya how ya how ya how ya how ya
Do that there
How ya do that(x4)
And they be like
How ya do that
How ya do that there
How ya do that there
How ya how ya how ya how ya how ya

(Yung Berg)
Goes carolina mice
Sky blue and yellow

Bout to battle Carmelo

Im the Prince of da Ghetto
Neva did it but my dude's stay clappin dat metal
If rappin was a sport

I'd be on the court
Ova c's, YB's
Bout to win the gold medal
Cus these girls all love me
Valentines day is everyday around me
Minus the bow and arrow
