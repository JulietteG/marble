Count down another day has come and gone away
Barely found the time to breathe
I get so caught up in all I wanna do,
Sometimes I forget about You
And all the plans You have for me

Before I make the same mistake
For one more day I, I just wanna say

[Chorus]
Any where You want me, that's where I wanna be
Any way You want me, that's the way I wanna be
Any time You call me, I want You to hear me say,
'Lord, use me any which way.'

Rewind to another time when I really made up my mind
To let Your will be what will be
And I push play to live another day
Have faith that everything's OK
With more of You and less of me

'Cause I know I am nothing on my own
And I just, I want you to know

Any where You want me, that's where I wanna be
Any way You want me, that's the way I wanna be
Any time You call me, I want You to hear me say,
'Lord, use me any which way.'

[rap]
Push play, live another day
Have faith that everything's OK
Push play, live another day
Have faith that everything's gonna be OK

Push play, live another day
Have faith that everything's OK
Push play, live another day
Have faith that everything's gonna be OK

Any where You want me, that's where I wanna be
Any way You want me, that's the way I wanna be
Any time You call me, I want You to hear me say,
'Lord, use me any which way,"
Any time you call me, I want You to hear me say,
'Lord, use me, any which way.'---Lyrics submitted by Mackenzie.
