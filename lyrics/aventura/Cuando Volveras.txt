I don't know whats going on
With my baby
Porque ya no me quiere ver
She doesn't want to talk to me

She left one early in the morning
Without reasons
Sin dejarme una cartita
Or a clue where she might be at
I don't think that I deserve what you have done
I don't sleep and I don't eat esperando' for your love

Cuando volveras
When will you come back
Ay dime mami adonde tu estaras
When will you come back
Cuando volveras
Dime morena ay adonde andaras

(Tell me why, tell me why)
Me haces esto mujer
(If I always loved you)
Veni y vuelve otra vez
(Tell me why, tell me why)
Me haces esto mujer
(If I always loved you)

Let me find out.

Oye que feeling mami

My heart is in pain and I need your love
Oh please call a doctor 
Y que vuelva mi morena
I miss her day and night
Nothing has changed and 
the only thing I have is on 
the wall, her picture frame

Cuando volveras
When will you come back
Ay dime mami adonde tu andaras
When will you come back
Cuando volveras
Ay dime baby if you're ever coming back

(Tell me why, tell me why)
Me haces esto mujer
(If I always loved you)
Veni y vuelve otra vez
(Tell me why, tell me why)
You are doing this to me
(If I always loved you)
Veni y vuelve otra vez

Cuando volveras (x12) ---Lyrics submitted by ruby.
