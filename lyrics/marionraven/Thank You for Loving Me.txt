You look beautiful tonight
As you turn down the light
You could be anywhere with anyone
But you're here with me tonight

Red candle light
Is glowing in your eyes
The lust is burning too
As you hold me close to you
And you promise me tonight

I'm gonna spend my whole life just trying
To keep love from dying, on me
I'm gonna spend my whole life faking
To keep us from breaking
I'll make you see
So take my hand
Thank you for loving me

Took a look at myself
I'm not a baby anymore
You know I miss you when I'm gone
For your body I will long
Can't believe I'm finally home

I never wanna see you sad
I never wana bring you down
I never wanna make you lie

I'm gonna spend my whole life just trying
To keep love from dying, on me
I'm gonna spend my whole life faking
To keep us from breaking
I'll make you see
So take my hand
Thank you for loving me

I'm gonna spend my whole life just trying
To keep love from dying, on me
I'm gonna spend my whole life faking
To keep us from breaking
I'll make you see
So take my hand
Thank you for loving me---Lyrics submitted by jhoanne.
