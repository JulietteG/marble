California, then we fell into the shining sea
The weight that drags your heart down
Well thats what took me where I need to be
Which is here
Out on Zuma
Watching you cry like a baby
California, at the dawn you thought would never come
But it did
Like it always does

All I know
And all I need to know is there is no end to love

I didnt call you
Words can scare a thought away
Everyones a star in our town
Its just your light gets dimmer if you have to stay
In your bedroom
In a mirror
Watching yourself cry like a baby
California, blood orange sunset brings you to your knees
Ive seen for myself
Theres no end to grief
Thats how I know

Thats how I know
And why I need to know that there is no end to love
All I know and all I need to know is there is no end to love

All I know
And all I need to know is there is no end to love
We come and go
Stolen days you dont give back
Stolen days are just enough---
