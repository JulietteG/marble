I could be lying next to anyone
But Im still thinking of you
Youre like the lighter to my cigarette
Cant set the flame without you

And if you want me to come over, baby
Then thats what Im gonna do
Just give me all your loving and dont slow down
And dont you dare hold back at all

Go down and take me up to heaven
Oh, how I live just to be next to you
I need you here with me forever
I live for you to love me

La la la la la love me, love me, love me, love me
Love me like its prom night
I wanna hold you close like its the very first time
La la la la la love me, love me, love me, love me
Love me like its prom night
Wanna be this fantasy all night with you

Go down and take me up to heaven
I live for you to love me

Take me up to heaven

La la la la la love me, love me, love me, love me
Love me like its prom night
I wanna hold you close like its the very first time
La la la la la love me, love me, (I want you to) love me, love me
(I wanna hold you so close) Love me like its prom night
Wanna be this fantasy all night with you---Lyrics submitted by Noir.
