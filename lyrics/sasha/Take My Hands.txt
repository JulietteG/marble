Come on little darling, be mine
Is it true that you worry about
The things I do for you?

I will always be on your side
So just move a little closer
And everything will be alright

Take my hands
Won't you take my hands?
Darling, take my hands
And fly away

And darling, take my hands

Does anybody know how I feel?
Finally we can make it
I lead you to a brighter day

Every time I look in your eyes
My heart is beating faster
I never ever tell you lies

Take my hands
Won't you take my hands?
Darling, take my hands
And fly away, yeah
Darling, take my hands

Can I hold you in my arms tonight? Oh
And I'll be everyone you need
Words cannot express the way I feel
I wanna give you all the love that I've got
If you take my hands

Oh, take my hands

Take my hands
Won't you take my hands?
Darling, take my hands
And fly away, hey, yeah

Oh, oh, take my hands
Won't you take my hands?
Darling, take my hands
And fly away, hey, hey
Darling, take my hands

Hands, won't you take my hands?
(My hands, no)
Hands, won't you take my hands?
(My hands, yo, oh)

Hands, won't you take my hands?
(I said come on take my hands, yeah)
Hands, won't you take my hands?
(Come on, baby, take my hands)

Hands, won't you take my hands?
(Let me body get cold, yeah)
Hands, won't you take my hands?
(Oh, take my hands)
Hands, won't you take my hands?
