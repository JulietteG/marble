I guess I thought you'd be here forever
Another illusion I chose to create
You dont know what you
got until its gone
And found out a little too late

I was acting as if you
were lucky to have me
Doin?you a favor I hardly
knew you were there
But then you were gone
and it was all wrong
Had no idea how much I cared

Chorus

Now being without you
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
But I dont want to
Living without you
Is all a big mistake
Instead of getting easier
Its the hardest thing to take
Im addicted to ya babe
Youre a hard habit to break

You found someone else
you had every reason
You know I cant blame you
for runnin?to him
Two people together but living alone
I was spreading my love too thin

After all these years
Im still tryin?to shake it
Doin?much better they say that it
Just takes time
But deep in the night its
an endless flight
I cant get ya out of my mind

Chorus

2nd Chorus

Being without you
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
I dont want to
Being without you
Is all a big mistake
Instead of getting easier
Its the hardest thing to take
Im addicted to ya babe
Youre a hard habit to break---Lyrics submitted by Cecily.
