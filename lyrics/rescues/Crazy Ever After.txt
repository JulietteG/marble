Today youre gonna leave
Just like you did the day before
Watch by the windowsill
You disappear into the corner store
I could swear that I saw you
Slip out the backdoor
You left your set of keys
And left me alone

Im missing our apartment
My heads a broken record
I cant think
I keep repeating
The very last thing that you said to me
You didnt tell me you loved me
Just goodbye
And there was something kinda final in it

Stay
Everything is wrong without you
Stay
My whole worlds a wreck
Or will you save me now
Or leave me crazy ever after

Im in a weak condition
Now that you cut into the heart of me
You got my mind racing
Losing my grip on reality
You got me second guessing
Whats true and whats a lie
Why dont you look me in the eye
When I say

Stay
Everything is wrong without you
Stay
My whole worlds a wreck 
Or will you save me now
Or leave me crazy ever after

I dont know how to be alone
I dont know how to be alone
Dont know how to be alone

Today youre gonna leave
Just like you did the day before

Stay
Everything is wrong
Stay
My whole worlds a wreck
Stay
Stay
Stay, stay
Or will you save me now
Or leave me crazy ever after---Lyrics submitted by Jessica.
