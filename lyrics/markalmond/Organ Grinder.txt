Here comes the organ grinder with his little dancing monkey
I remember he used to play outside the house when I was young
And the man who mended chairs and the one who sharpened knives
And the lady who sold lavender with laughter in her eyes
Funny how the time goes, and you never seem to notice till they're gone

I remember my first bicycle, my father brought it for me
I remember crying, for it wasn't painted red
I didn't know it then, but we didn't have much money
And he must have gone without a lot just to see me smile
Funny how the time goes, and you never seem to notice till they're gone---Lyrics submitted by Dan.
