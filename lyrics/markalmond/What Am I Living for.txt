Well I said to my best friend, can't you see what a mess I'm in?
My daddy he taught me to drink whisky
But my momma she died from a-drinkin' gin

My brother, he works in a coal mine, works so hard to get his pay
My sister, she believes in sweet lord Jesus
And she's waitin' for redemption day

What am I livin' for?
Why am I living, why am I giving all my life
To bring up a family, children, and wife
Tell me my friend hasn't that been done before?

I remember my first job, I was singin' with a band
Every payday came around
I'd take my money from the man

He said "Now spend it wisely, boy, or save it while you have the time"
But I got drunk on a stand
And I blew the band
Now I'm standing in the unemployment line

What am I livin' for?
Why am I living, why am I giving all my life
To bring up a family, children, and wife
Tell me my friend hasn't that been done before?

I had me a sweet woman, mine until the sun don't shine
I came home one morning, early
And I found her with a friend of mine

It's not so much I needed her
But oh, God, how to stay away
I packed my bags, and I hit the road
And I've never seen her to this day

What am I livin' for?
Why am I living, why am I giving all my life
To bring up a family, children, and wife
Listen my friend, its been done before ---Lyrics submitted by riccardo.
