PART I

Lonely highway, like a river stretching
And my headlights glaring
And my eyes are staring
Into the night and the rain.

Static on the radio,
A hard night's driving left to go
Rhythm of the wipers slow
I'm driving into the night and the rain.

Big rigs are roaring by,
Must be doing eighty-five.
Coming up so fast behind
It's enought to make me lose my mind in the rain.

Wish I had a CB radio,
Then I'd know how fast to go.
The gas is running pretty low
But the signs say "no change."
And I've a twenty-dollar bill.

Here comes the rain,
Always the rain.

But after the rain, the blue sky.
And where I'm going, the sun is shining.
And soon, with the dawn, the sun will rise.
She'll open her eyes and I'll be home.

Goddamn, the heater switch sticks,
Making me sleepy.
And it looks kinda creepy
But I guess it's time I got out for a while.
In the rain.

The air is like crystal
And the temperature's zero,
But I've got to clear my head.
And where I am, God only knows,
Somewhere in the rain

Here comes the rain,
Always the rain.

But after the rain, the blue sky.
And where I'm going, the sun is shining.
And soon, with the dawn, the sun will rise.
She'll open her eyes and I'll be home.

PART II

How many stars in the night sky?
How many worlds do we see without knowing?
How many times must a man try?
How many lives do we waste without growing?

Pull yourself together, man.
Your emotions are getting out of hand.
To hell with that philosophy.
Goddamn, I lost the key in the rain.

Ah, hell! That's all I need,
Highway patrol to check my speed.
They don't know how I need
Just to get home out of the rain.

Here comes the rain,
Always the rain.

But after the rain, the blue sky.
And where I'm going, the sun is shining.
And soon, with the dawn, the sun will rise.
She'll open her eyes and I'll be home.---Lyrics submitted by Stephen.
