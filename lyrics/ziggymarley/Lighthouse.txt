Hey sister, the emotions have gone cold
And a part of me is missing,
Where the rivers used to flow
Hey mother, I know you must be sad
To see the things are happening
I'll fix it if I can

I'm holding up the fire
Lighting up the sky
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
Bring you home alright
I'm holding up the fire (Holding up the fire)
Lighting up the sky (Lighting up the sky)
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
Bring you home alright

Hey brother, some things never change
Caesar's always Caesar, and night comes into day
Hey father, they sold you like a slave
To a world that takes everything,
And gives nothing away

I'm holding up the fire
Lighting up the sky
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
Bring you home alright
I'm holding up the fire (Holding up the fire)
Lighting up the sky (Lighting up the sky)
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
Bring you home alright

Yeah, I'm holding up the fire
Lighting up the sky
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
Bring you home alright
I'm holding up the fire (Holding up the fire)
Lighting up the sky (Lighting up the sky)
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
I'll bring you home alright

Holding up the fire,
I'm lighting up the sky
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
I bring your home alright
Holding up the fire,
I'm lighting up the sky
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
I bring your home alright

I'm holding up the fire,
Oh one love ---
