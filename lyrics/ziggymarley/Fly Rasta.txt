Fly rasta, you fly rasta 
Fly rasta, you fly rasta 
Chedda don che 
Not to have to hold up yo head, do 
Redder than red 
We work fo' that red 

Take that velvet separation onto the love 
You know strom them see the dead 
And all the days of yo vow-up separation 
No rays of shroud will come upon yo head 

Fly rasta, you fly rasta 
Fly rasta, you fly rasta 
Root to them roots 
My spirit speak the truth 
Cutter than cute 
I might cheat god, boya 

Now there's an evil that we see under the sun 
Bitches comein' around men 
What have the fool moon and the wise 
Band can't live alone unbread 
Wear it, I would say 
Enlighten the laws of jaja 
With the most ganja 
The fellows meditate, 
Living better than lifting house over the Sanomany 
Like the tree granted by water 
Poverty don't spit the man don folley 
These leaves never wither 

Fly rasta, you fly rasta 
Fly rasta, you fly rasta 
Chedda don che 
Not to have to hold up yo head, do 
Redder than red 
We work fo' that red 

When I say blessin' to the money come walking out dotti 
And standing in the way of civil life, I would say 
Take a vow of separation 
And all the days of your life 
Let no rays come down upon your self---
