Don't wanna live on mars
I don't wanna drive space cars
I just wanna be with you
And do the things we do
Don't want to escape to the moon
Even if the world went boom
I just want to be with you
And do the right things to you

You give me everything I need
You're my garden, You're my breeze
Let me get down, and thank you please
Hey let me lay here for a while,
Cause you're beauty makes me high
If you cry then I will cry
Yeah, let me make one thing clear
Nothing can compare
You're love is the blue sky
You're love is a butterfly

I don't want to live on mars
I don't want to drive space cars
I just want to be with you
And do the things we do
Don't want to escape to the moon
Even if the world went boom
I just want to be with you
And do the right things to you

Oh good karma you're my queen,
Precious things my eyes have seen
Sweetest place I've ever been
You make me feel just like a king,
I'll never leave you for that girl
Oh my darling you're my world
That witch called winter is so mean,
Summers that I've never seen,
They say I'm love crazy, love crazy

Can't take the heat turn down the fire
Can't swim don't tempt the waters
Believe what you want, this is my point of view
I wanna be cool, so let me get through to you

I don't want to live on mars
I don't want to drive space cars
I just want to be with you
And do the things we do
Don't want to escape to the moon
Even if the world went boom
I just want to be with you
And do the right things to you

I don't want to live on mars
I don't want to drive space cars
I just want to be with you
And do the things we do
Don't want to escape to the moon
Even if the world went boom
I just want to be with you
And do the right things to you ---
