What has happened down here, is the wind have changed
Clouds rolled in from the north and it started to rain
It rained real hard, and it rained for a real long time
Six feet of water in the streets of Evangeline

River rose all day, the river rose all night
Some people got lost in the flood, some people got a way alright
River had busted through clear down the Placker mine
Six feet of water in the streets of Evangeline

Louisiana, Louisiana
They're trying to wash us away, they're trying to wash us away
Oh, Louisiana, Louisiana
They're trying to wash us away, they're trying to wash us away

President Coolidge come down, in a railroad train
Little fat man with a note pad in his hand
President say, "Little fat man, oh isn't it a shame
What the river have done to this poor farmer's land"

Oh, Louisiana, Louisiana
They're trying to wash us away, you're trying to wash us away
Oh, Louisiana, oh Lord, oh Louisiana
They're trying to wash us away, oh, Lord, they're trying to wash us away
They're trying to wash us away, they're trying to wash us away---
