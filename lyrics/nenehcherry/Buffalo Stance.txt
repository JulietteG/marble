Who's that gigolo on the street 
With his hands in his pockets and his crocadile feet 
Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed 
At the boys from home. They all came running 
They were making noise, manhandling toys 
That's the girls on the block with the nasty curls 
Wearing padded bras sucking beers through straws 
Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours? 

Gigolo, Huh, sucka? 
Gigolo. Gigolo, Huh, sucka? 

Who's looking good today? 
Who's looking good in every way? 
No style rookie 
You better watch don't mess with me 

No moneyman can win my love 
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of 
We always hang in a Buffalo Stance 
We do the dive every time we dance 
I'll give you love baby not romance 
I'll make a move nothing left to chance 
So don't you get fresh with me 

Get funky. Yeah Timmy 
Tell it like it is. Check out this DJ 

So you say you wanted money but you know it's never funny 
When your shows worn through and there's a rumble in your tummy 
But you had to have style get a gold tooth smile 
Put a girl on the corner so you can make a pile 
Committed a crime and went inside 
It was coming your way but you had to survive 
When you lost your babe, you lost the race 
Now you're looking at me to take her place 

Who's looking good today? 
Who's looking good in every way? 
No style rookie 
You better watch don't mess with me 

Smokin.' Not cokin.' Get funky sax 
Looking good, hanging with the wild bunch 
Looking good in a Buffalo Stance 
Looking good when it comes to the crunch 
Looking good's a state of mind 
State of mind don't look behind you 
State of mind or you'll be dead 
State of mind may I remind you 
Bomb the Bass rock this place 
What is he like? What's he like anway? 
Yo' man what do you expect the guy's a giggolo man 
You know I mean? 

No moneyman can win my love 
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of 
We always hang in a Buffalo Stance 
We do the dive every time we dance 
I'll give you love baby not romance 
I'll make a move nothing left to chance 
So don't you get fresh with me 

No moneyman can win my love 
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of 
We always hang in a Buffalo Stance 
We do the dive every time we dance 
I'll give you love baby not romance 
I'll make a move nothing left to chance 
So don't you get fresh with me 

Wind on my face, sound in my ears 
Water from my eyes, and you on my mind 
As I sink, diving down deep deeper into your soul 

No moneyman can win my love 
It's sweetness that I'm thinking of 
We always hang in a Buffalo Stance 
We do the dive every time we dance 
I'll give you love baby not romance 
I'll make a move nothing left to chance 
So don't you get fresh with me---
