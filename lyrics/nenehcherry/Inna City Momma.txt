Yo!, Wait a minute...we  We gotta do another one..

(inna city mamma)

When I loved you....
When I loved you...

When I loved you..From a distance
And your skyline, Made me a promise
In my safe world, To be somebody
New York city, To own your streets
Where I strut, Covered in money
Shattered dreams, It aint funny
Now I look at you, With tears in my eyes
The good, The Bad, The Ugly, As I start to cry
I search for the sky, Just a breeze and watch a block of darkening clouds they coming

Inna City Mamma, Ya bore another child
To be a victim of your cold blooded ways
Inna City Love, From the gutter
So destructive, When you sing your blues
I wanna love ya baby, I dont mean maybe baby
But I need everything you got
(I'm gonna touch you) 
I'm Inna city hunger, You think your tough, I'm stronger
If your weak, I'll eat you up
(you're meant to love me) I'm gonna touch you
Where you never been touched before
Deep in your spine, I'll bruise your veins
And touch your very core (you're meant to love me)

Inna City Mamma, Ya bore another child
To be a victim of your cold blooded ways
Inna City Love, From the gutter
So destructive, When you sing your blues
(Rap)
Look at this city, Breeding suckers
Sleeping on the concrete, Living in the gutter
While a chosen few, Rocking the cradle
Sipping sweet milk from a golden ladle
So I walk down the street, Dressed with bodies
Chill of the night, Where the victims party
Underneath the sky, Where rooftops suck
Coz you aint got a home to rest your butt!

(Inner City Mamma) (you meant to love me)
(but you cut meup)
repeat x2
