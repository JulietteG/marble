Boul ma sene, boul ma guiss madi re nga fokni mane
Khamouma li neka thi sama suuf ak thi guinaw
Beugouma kouma khol daldine yaw li neka si yaw
Mo ne si man li ne si mane moye dilene diapale

Roughness and rudeness, we should be using
On the ones who practice wicked charms
For the sword and the stone, bad to the bone
Battle's not over even when it's won

And when a child is born into this world
It has no concept of the tone the skin is living in

It's not a second, seven seconds away
Just as long as stay, I'll be waiting
It's not a second, seven seconds away
Just as long as stay, I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting

J'assume les raisons qui nous poussent de changer tout
J'aimerais qu'on oublie leur couleur pour qu'ils esprent
Beaucoup de sentiments de race qui font qu'ils dsesprent
Je veux les deux mains ouvertes
Des amis pour parler de leur peine
De leur joie pour qu'ils leur filent
Des infos qui ne divisent pas changer

Seven seconds away
Just as long as stay, I'll be waiting
It's not a second, seven seconds away
Just as long as stay, I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting

And when a child is born into this world
It has no concept of the tone the skin is living in
And there's a million voices
And there's a million voices
To tell you what she should be thinking
So you better sober up for just a second

Seven seconds away
Just as long as stay, I'll be waiting
It's not a second, seven seconds away
Just as long as stay, I'll be waiting
It's not a second, seven seconds away
Just as long as stay, I'll be waiting
It's not a second, seven seconds away
Just as long as stay, I'll be waiting
It's not a second, seven seconds away
Just as long as stay, I'll be waiting---Lyrics submitted by mariana.
