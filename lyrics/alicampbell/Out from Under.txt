Breath you out
Breath you in
U keep coming back to tell me
you're the one who could have been
and my eyes see it all so clear
It was long ago and far away but it never disappears
I try to put it in the past
Hold on to myself and don't look back

I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm Out From Under
I dont wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm Out From Under

So let me go
Just let me fly away
Let me feel the space between us growing deeper
And darker every day
Watch me now and I'll be someone new
My heart will be unbroken
It will open up for everyone but you
Even when I cross the line
Its like a lie I've told a thousand times

I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm Out From Under
I dont wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm Out From Under

And part of me still believes'. when u
Say you're gonna stick around
And part of me still believes.
We can find a way to work it out
But I know that we tried everything we could try
So lets just say good-bye
Forever

I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm Out From Under
I dont wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm Out From Under---Lyrics submitted by Michel.
