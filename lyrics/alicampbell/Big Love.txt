Home come you think about the children
You tell me one day we will ????
When ammunition don't live where they play

And then the next generation
Will need a new dedication
To take the guns away, hey

Instead of cry cry crying
We'll be shaking hands ????
Instead of die die dieing
We'd be dancing to the beat

Big lolololololololololove
Big lolololololololololove

Big love
Big lolololololololololove
Let there'd be no devastation
A new United Nation

Big lolololololololololove
A new United Nation
Take the problems all away, hey

And then we'll find a direction
Come let us make the connection (big love)
Teach the children how to play

Big love, yeah come on
Big lolololololololololove

Big love
Big love
Big love
Big love

Big love
Oh lord
