I had nothing to do on this hot afternoon
 but to settle down and write you a line
 I've been meaning to phone you but from Minnesota
 hell it's been a very long time
 You wear it well
 A little old fashioned but that's all right

Well I suppose you're thinking I bet he's sinking
 or he wouldn't get in touch with me
 Oh I ain't begging or losing my head
 I sure do want you to know that you wear it well
 There ain't a lady in the land so fine

Remember them basement parties, your brother's karate
 the all day rock and roll shows
 Them homesick blues and radical views
 haven't left a mark on you, you wear it well
 A little out of time but I don't mind

But I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
 but I blew it without even tryin'
 Now I'm eatin' my heart out
 tryin' to get a letter through

Since you've been gone it's hard to carry on
 I'm gonna write about the birthday gown that I bought in town
 when you sat down and cried on the stairs
 You knew it did not cost the earth, but for what it's worth
 You made me feel a millionaire and you wear it well
 Madame Onassis got nothing on you

Anyway, my coffee's cold and I'm getting told
 that I gotta get back to work
 So when the sun goes low and you're home all alone
 think of me and try not to laugh and I wear it well
 I don't object if you call collect
 'cos I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
 but I blew it without even tryin'
 Now I'm eatin' my heart out tryin' to get back to you

After all the years I hope it's the same address
 Since you've been gone it's hard to carry on---Lyrics submitted by Snedler.
