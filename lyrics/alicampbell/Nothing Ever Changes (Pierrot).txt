The Pierrot dances on
In ever faster paces
The mask remains in place
And nothing ever changes
The headlines scream the news
Another scandal rages
But the Pierrot dances on
And nothing ever changes

The golden goddess
So loved and mourned
By Hollywood's elite
Whilst evidence was placed and lost
Investigations incomplete
Conspiracies abound
Amid our brothers watchful eye
But despite our need to know
We're still drowning in their lies

The Pierrot dances on
In ever faster paces
The mask remains in place
And nothing ever changes
The headlines scream the news
Another scandal rages
But the Pierrot dances on 
Still nothing ever changes

From atop the grassy knoll 
A hidden snipers view
But still all these years later
What was false and what was true
Uncovered plots and secret plans
We follow every lead
We analyse and theorise
About the jigsaw piece we need

So history repeats it's lesson
One we can't dismiss
And over time an English rose
Is added to their list
We watch underhand manoeuvres
From Wallstreet to Iran
The fates of twins in blackened skies
Lies buried in the sand

The Pierrot dances on
In ever faster paces
The mask remains in place
And nothing ever changes
The headlines scream the news
As another scandal rages
But the Pierrot dances on
Still nothing ever changes


No doubt there is a lot frustration and fear and pain
I see you isolate the joy and now you search of fame
And the balance of your past and your brain
Remember that the rhythm of life will sustain
GentlemanWhen will whe find our ways find and unify
Said we'll never know if we will never give or try
So long we have been living in confusion
Never came to realise we dwell in our illusion

The Pierrot dances on
Another scandal rages
But the Pierrot dances on

No doubt there is a lot frustration and fear and pain
I see you isolate the joy and now you search of fame
And the balance of your paste and your brain
GentlemanRemember that the rhythm of life will sustain
When will we find our ways find and unify
Said we'll never know if we will never give or try
So long we have been living in confusion
Never came to realise we dwell in our illusion
