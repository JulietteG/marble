I want one of those,
in fact I want two,
One just for me, a spare one for you.
I want one of those,
a different view,
I'm tired of the old, I need something new.

I want to disclose my secrets to you,
I might be smiling but inside im blue.

Don't make me wake from my sweet dream,
Don't ever take what might have been,
It's not a lot, try not to steal,
It's all I've got from a Raw Deal.

The Life that I chose, you give what you get,
Never complain, it ain't over yet,
I want some new clothes, some brand new hair do,
It don't have to cost much for a new pair of shoes.

And then I suppose a limousine ride,
to take me away with you by my side.

Don't make me wake from my sweet dream,
Don't ever take what might have been,
It's not a lot, try not to steal,
It's all I've got from a Raw Deal.

I want one of those,
in fact I want two,
One just for me, a spare one for you.
I want one of those,
a different view,
I'm tired of the old, I need something new.

And then I suppose a limousine ride,
to take me away with you by my side.

Don't make me wake from my sweet dream,
Don't ever take what might have been,
It's not a lot, try not to steal,
It's all I've got from a Raw Deal.

Don't make me wake from my sweet dream,
Don't ever take what might have been,
It's not a lot, try not to steal,
It's all I've got from a Raw Deal.---Lyrics submitted by Darren.
