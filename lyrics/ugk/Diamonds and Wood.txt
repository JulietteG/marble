[Chorus:]
I flips down the ave, now I'm lookin good
I'm bangin' screw nigga diamonds up against that wood
I flips down the ave, now I'm lookin good
I'm bangin screw, nigga diamonds up against that wood

[Pimp C:]
I flippin down the ave you know I'm lookin tight
These jealous niggas lookin at me and my car so shife
Wanna take my life, and wanna jack, but I see all through that
Never let these bitch niggas take what's mine, nigga neva do that
Fool say he going through a thang when ya'll ain't neva lied
I got a baby, but his mama act like he ain't mine
Wicked women using children, to live on
Wanna hurt, and try to hate, cause she know the thrill is gone
Say man I stopped smokin with haters back in 94
But niggas be thinkin that a sweet gone get em through my door
And niggas talk a lot of shit in a safe place
I know, cause he can't look me eye-to-eye when he in my face
Now nigga listten to my piece and see just what I mean
Nigga I ride dirty everyday, but still I shine so clean
Glitter and gleam ain't all what it look like
So I keep swangin' out here clangin' tryin to live my life

[Chorus x2]

[Bun B:]
And see these niggas and days go and come
And fo me just to wake, I know I'm blessed
I grab my cis and split my swisher with my bunk
Some of my sweet be tight and some of my sweets be fucked up
But all my sweets gone blow, so killas smoked get sucked up
I lucked up today and didn't fall prey to none of that pistol play
But who's to say tomorrow they won't be blastin this-a-way
I'm puffin spliffs of hay, still upset about the drama here
At this time of year I'm wiping away by dead homey's mama's tears, but shit
But naturally them fucking laws is after me
So I have to be on that manner on that 5-0-3
I'm living dastardly
Must be all about survival G
These niggas passin me streets just keep on getting live with me
They say it has to be another way, but I ain't feelin that
They tried to steal the Lac, and my wig they wanna peel it back
But still the fact remains, it's all about the cane swang and bang
Peace to E-S-G and all the victims of the game man

[Chorus x3]

[Pimp C:]
I'm flippin through P.A I'm tryin to see some good
But everythang is still the same up in my neoghborhood
Niggas frown when you up and smile when you down
And when you change for the betta shife fools stop comin around
I see the jealousy and hatein in the wicked ways
We all lost children, praising paper, smoking our lives away
Got to the point where I could not decipher day from night
She say say love me but all we do now is fuckin' fight
My conscience fuck with me so much that I can't eat or sleep
The other side is sellin dope and out there runnin the streets
And even though I'm gaining street fame coming from this rap game
Lustful thinkin and compulsive drinkin is a normal thang
Some get erased and misplaced tryin to win the race
Some try to hold on to their place by smoking with lace
But see drugs and plastic thugs ain't gone change the hood
I'm smokin skunk and poppin trunks to make me feel good

I flips down the ave now I'm lookin good
I'm smokin skunk and popping trunks to make me feel good
