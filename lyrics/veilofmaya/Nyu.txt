Enslaved in a place that's referred to as home
We are all too afraid to be cast out alone
Our strength is unknown
They claim the end to be imminent

Though we live on
Infinite

We must make amends
There is only one way that this can end

Enslaved in a place
We are too afraid
Enslaved in a place we call home

I'm still fucking numb

We must make amends
There is only one way that this can end---
