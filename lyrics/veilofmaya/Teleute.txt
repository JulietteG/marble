The thorns protruding from the vines. They penetrate
Deep enough to kill the fight
That I have harnessed all my life
That I have harnesses all of my life
Compared just as brothers
Let's not pretend that we each know the other
Neither is greater. Compared just as brothers

We are simply distinguished
One of the same
Bred from a different place
Your hate - It penetrates

Caught under a blanket of fire
I am who I am. Now dragged under
With a smirk so pretentious
You are who you are, now pulled under

Compared just as brothers
I'm alone within a black hole
Turmoil suffocates
I am left to suffer
I will engrave the demise of my brother
I'm alone within a black hole---
