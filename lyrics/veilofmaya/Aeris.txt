Have faith and you won't be left behind
Haunted by the thoughts of a failed life
Self realize

There's a message embedded in my mind
I see it over and over
Every time that I shut my eyes
I am finally awake
This is the end of a nightmare

This is the end
I am finally awake
This is the end of a nightmare

This is the end
We will live
And forgive the mistakes they've made
Surrounded with trust
We won't make the same

Self realize
I am finally awake
Self realize
I am finally awake
We fill with hope
I am finally awake
This is the end of a nightmare

Haunted by the thoughts of a failed life
Leave behind the thoughts of a failed life
This is the end

We will live and forgive the mistakes they've made
Surrounded with trust
We won't make the same

Self realize
I am finally awake
Self realize
I am finally awake
Our lives will fill with hope
I am finally awake
They've only foreshadowed our own

Have faith and you won't be left behind

Until our guidance
Until our guidance is that alone
Until our guidance
Until our guidance is that alone
Until our guidance
Until our guidance is that alone
Until our guidance
Until our guidance is that alone---
