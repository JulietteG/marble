it was a cool winter's morning
somewhere shortly past 9 AM
the armored car they wanted to heist wasn't coming
so instead they went for the bank

the fateful duo that sat in the get-away car
heavily sedated with thousands of rounds
armor piercing, fully automatic weapons
the bowls of wrath poured out on the ground

baptized in a firefight, hot blood running cold as ice
44 minutes of target practice, all hell's breaking loose
outgunned, watching "the force" come to a firefight with a pocketknife
getting schooled until they shot Achilles' heel
and brought down the beast


that was an accident waiting to happen
it wasn't if it would happen, it was when
the city's people sabotaged themselves
calling their firepower an unneeded expense

the two most violent men it seemed couldn't be stopped
standard police issue guns were just not enough
but SWAT arrived and settled the fight
between AK-47 and AR-15---Lyrics submitted by Shannon.
