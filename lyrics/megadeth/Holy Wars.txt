(verse 1)
Brother will kill brother
Spilling blood across the land
Killing for religion
Something I don't understand

Fools like me, who cross the sea
And come to forgien lands
Ask the sheep, for their beliefs
Do you kill on God's comand?

A country that's divided 
Surely will not stand
My past erased, no more disgrace
No foolish naive stand

The End is near, it's crystal clear
Part of the master plan
Don't look now to Israel
It might be in your homelands

HOLY WARS!!!

(Acoustic guitar solo & Change in tempo)
Upon the podium, as the 
Know it all scholar
Down in my seat of judgement 
Gavels bang, uphold the law

Up on my soapbox, a leader 
Out to change the world
Down in my pulpit as the holier
Than thou could be messanger of God

(Tempo Change)
Wage the war on organized crimes
Sneak attacks, repel down the rocks
Behind the lines

Some people risk to employ me
Some people live to destroy me
Either way they die
THEY DIE!!!

(guitar solo)
They killed my wife and my baby
With hopes to enslave me
First mistake
Last mistake

Paid by the allience
To slay all the giants
Next mistake
No more mistakes

(guitar solo)
(change in tempo)
Fill the cracks in
With judicial granite
Because I don't say it
Don't mean I ain't thinkin' it

Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away
I know what I said
Now I must scream
Of the O-Ver-Dose!

And the lack...of...mercy killings
Mercy killings
Mercy killings
Killings,killings, killings

Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away!!!---Lyrics submitted by jeffrey.
