What you don't know the legend ghost can hurt you
If you only want to live and die in fear
They tell us to believe just half of what we see
And absolutely nothing that we hear

Resist the twist the truth no matter what the cost
So plant the rights for wrongs inside our heads
Outlawing all the questions to the answers
That no one likes but someone answer did

Dystopia

What you don't know the legend ghost can hurt you
If you only want to live and die in a cage
There's panic and there's chaos, ramping in the streets
Where useless thoughts of peace are met with rage

Demoralize the know for master people think
The quickest way to end the war is lose
Dictatorship and starting with to run aside
You must destroy the cancer at it's roots

Dystopia---
