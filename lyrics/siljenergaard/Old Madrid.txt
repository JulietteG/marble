When back to back sleeping
is cold to the touch
And the silence were keeping  
Doesnt hold very much
When i see winds chase
Every trace of romance
So far out of reach
Lets remember a dance
On an evening when music captured our hearts
And the moment was ours

made us a part of you

Old madrid
Our love was echo by your walls
And every street let to us
In old madrid
Now when the city calls

Our hearts will live the love and joy of old madrid
Were back there and -

Live on a memory 
Cling to a dream
Pretend that our longing are less than they seem
Kind for those summers
When all was unknown
And stay there a while
Though we know time has flown 
Since an evening  when music captured our hearts 
and the moment was ours

Made us a part of you

Old madrid
Our love was echo by your walls
And every street let to us
In old madrid
Now when the city calls

Our hearts will live the love and joy of old madrid
Were back there once more---Lyrics submitted by Hannah Nergaard.
