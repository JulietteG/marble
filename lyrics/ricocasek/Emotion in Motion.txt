I would do anything
To hold on to you

'Caus just about anything
'Til you pull through

I'd hold on to you

'til the stars on longer wink
I'd hold on to you

'til you figure out
Just what to think, 
'Caus
You're emotion in motion's
A magical potion

You're emotion in motion
 to me


I would go anywhere
To meet up with you

'Caus just about anywhere
For one rendezvous

I'd hold on to you

Until the mountains crumble flat
I'd hold on to you

Until you figure out
Just what you're at
'Caus
You're emotion in motion
My magical potion

You're emotion in motion
 to me

(Musical Introlude)

I would do anything
To hold on to you

'Caus just about anything
That you want me to

I'll hold on to you

Until you take it all in stride
I'd hold on to you (ooh ooh) 

'Til you want to stay here
By my side, 
'Cause,
You're emotion in motion
A magical potion

You're emotion in motion

 to me...

Oh.
You're emotion in motion
(Oh)
Your magical potion

You're emotion in motion

 to me...

Oh..
You're emotion in motion  (Emotion in motion)

You're emotion in motion
 to me...---Lyrics submitted by BEN.
