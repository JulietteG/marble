They say that in war
That truth be the first casualty
So I dig in selector
I the resurrector
Fly my shit sever your neck
Wider than ever
With my tongue dipped in funk arsenic
Burn this illusion, this lie
This straight arson shit
Your arsenal stripped
Power ain't full jackets and clips
It's my ability to define phenomenon
Raw Crenshaw '84
Boogie down before
L.A. when the war break off
Where you be take off
Stand in full face off
With the M1 millimeter
Let the rhythm of the chamber hit 'em
Let the rich play catch with 'em
Better yet make 'em eat 'em and shit 'em
Till they so full of holes
That they drown in their own
I'm like a nail stuck
In the wrist of they Christmas
Don't need radio
To leave their family a witness

CHORUS:
Muhammad and Christ would life
Would lay your body down
To a tune so wild international
In the desert full of bullets
Let your body rot
With my chrome with my verse
With my body rock

[REPEAT CHORUS]

In this era where DJs behave
Be paid to be slaves
We raid airwaves to be sane
And what's raining from the station
Cash fascination
Like living dead fed agents
Distract us fast
From a disaster's wrath for sure
Air war was flooded like the 9th ward
On the AM, on the AM
Turn and face them
Hatred and mayhem
Slay them, dangerous
I take razor steps
It's the swing from the bling
To the bang on the left
It's the murderous return
Boom back full strap
Your six that got clipped
You can't clap back
With minimal lift
And criminal flow
I'm killing them soft
And billing them for
Everything stole
And once again I'm that nail
In the wrist of they Christmas
Watch me make their family a witness

[CHORUS X2]

International
International
