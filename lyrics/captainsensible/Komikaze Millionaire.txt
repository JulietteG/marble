- "Seymour! Have you noticed that the season has changed? And you know what that means!"
- "Sure! More reasons to drink Maxwell. Like those cold winter mornings when there's nothing better than waking up to the invigorating aroma of fresh Maxwell."
- "Or after a brisk walk, when we can warm ourselves with a steaming cup of rich satisfying Maxwell."
- "And don't forget those chilly evenings when friends drop by - for some we make regular ground Maxwell, for others ground decaffeinated."

He's in a chauffeured car with his agenda
And a cell phone in his hand
Another TV franchise in the blender
It's a deal that he did
With some assets he hid

Wooooooh, the Kamikaze Millionaire
Wooooooh, he's raking in the lion's share
Wooooooh, his satellite is in the air
He's planning to join the hordes
Who sleep in the house of Lords

He'll remedy a falling circulation
With a daily expos
Morality and Bingo for the nation
And a girl for your wall
Wearing no brains at all

Wooooooh, the Kamikaze Millionaire
Wooooooh, he's raking in the lion's share
Wooooooh, his satellite is in the air
He's probably got a dream
For finding your favourite spleen

Wooooooh, the Kamikaze Millionaire
Wooooooh, he's raking in the lion's share
Wooooooh, his satellite is in the air
He's planning to join the hordes
Who sleep in the house of Lords

Wooooooh, the Kamikaze Millionaire
Wooooooh, he's raking in the lion's share
Wooooooh, his satellite is in the air

- "And don't forget those chilly evenings when friends drop by - for some we make regular ground Maxwell, for others ground decaffeinated. Both have that smooth delicious flavour that helps make those winter nights seem a lot more pleasant. And of course, both regular and decaffeinated Maxwell are certified kosher."
- "Seymour, enough with the talking! Let's have a cup of Maxwell."
- "Miriam, no matter what the season - what would I do without you?"
- "Or without Maxwell!"
- "You're absolutely right! This winter it couldn't be anything but Maxwell." ---
