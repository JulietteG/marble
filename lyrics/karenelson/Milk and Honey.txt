Gold and Silver, is the autumn
Soft and gentle her skies.
Yes and no, are the answers,
Written in my true love's eyes.

Autumn's leaving, winter's coming,
I think I'll be moving on, got to leave him.
And find another, 
I've got to sing my heart's true song.

Round and round, the burning circle,
all the seasons, 1, 2, and 3
Autumn leaves, with the winter.
Spring is born, and wonders free

Gold and Silver, burnt my autumn,
all too soon they fade and die.
And then there were no others,
milk and honey were their lies.---Lyrics submitted by hayley tegg.
