Got me hanging on a string honey,
Got me hanging for dear life, 
mumma told me not to be so bold,
and now a pay a heavy price.

I fell head first into the fire,
what a foolish thing to do,
gambled every bit of sense I had,
and now Ive lost it all to you.

All to you, you take my breath,
my last request.
Is that you?, who'll always loved me the best.
So all your pretty babies,
can have the last laugh i guess.

still I'm hanging on a string honey,
still I'm hanging on a string,

Out on the street the bells are ringing, 
sad and sorry lonesome tune,
I watch the faces as they pass me by,
I'm hoping that Ill see you.

I call your phone it's disconnected,
It has somehow no longer stands,
guess the devil came and took back,
and now your life is in his hands.

All to you, you take my breath,
my last request,
Is that you? who'll always love me the best.
So all you pretty babies 
can have the last laugh I guess

Still I'm hanging on a string honey, 
still I'm hanging on a string.

Still I'm hanging on a string honey,
still I'm hanging on a string---Lyrics submitted by hayley tegg.
