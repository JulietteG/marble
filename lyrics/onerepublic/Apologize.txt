Im holding on your rope
Got me ten feet of the 
ground
And Im hearing what you 
say
But Im just cant make a 
sound

You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me 
down
But wait
You tell me that youre sorry
Didnt think Id turn around
and say

That its too late to
Apologize, its too late
I said its too late to
Apologize, its too late

Id take another chance, take
a fall, take a shot for 
you
And I need you like a heart
Needs a beat 
(But thats nothing new)
Yeah yeah

I loved you with a fire red,
now its turning blue
And you say
Sorry like the angel heaven
let me think was you
But Im afraid

Its too late to
Apologize, its too late
I said its too late to
Apologize, its too late
Woahooo woah

Its too late to Apologize,
its too late
I said its too late to Apologize,
its too late
I said its too late to Apologize,
yeah yeah
I said its too late to Apologize,
a yeah
Im holding on
your rope
Got me ten feet
Off the ground---Lyrics submitted by Anna Bernhardss.
