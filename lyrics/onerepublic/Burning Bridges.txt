You and I were meant to be 
Ain't no doubt about it 
No way to hide that sort of thing 
Now Im waiting for something better 
Ain't nothing better worth imagining 

I, I keep on running 
Im building bridges that I know you never wanted 
Look for my heart 
You stole it away 
Now Ill never sing the road that I could take 
Listen, I want you to burn my bridges down 
I said, I want you to burn my bridges down 
Set me on Fire 
You set me 
Set me on Fire 
You can burn my bridges down 

Send this out to sea 
Send it where you wanted 
You can take your no for no or not at all 
Theres no filling up your spaces with fictionary places 
Imaginary faces they dont work at all 

I, I keep on running 
Im building bridges that I know you never wanted 
Look for my heart 
You stole it away 
Now Ill never sing the road that I could take 
Listen, I want you to burn my bridges down 
I said, I want you to burn my bridges down 
Set me on Fire 
You set me 
Set me on Fire 
Girl you burnt my bridges down 

I want you to burn my bridges down, down 
I want you to burn my bridges down 
Set me on fire 
You set me 
Set me on Fire 
Set me on Fire 
I want you to burn my bridges down 
I said, I want you to burn my bridges down 
Down, Down 
Set me on fire 
Set me on fire---
