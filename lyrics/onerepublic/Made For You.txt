(One two three four one two three four
One two three four one two three four)

I was riding thinking with my long hand
Put dream to paper everything was sinking
Then start to wonder how you're gonna handle me
When I'm under, swimming in the darkest sea

Everybody wants to make it, it's all yours
Everybody wants to take it, it's all yours
Everybody wants to make it, it's all yours
Everybody wants to take it, t-t-take it

Can you feel all the love?
Can you feel all the love?
You feel all the love
Can you feel all the love like it was made for you?
Like it was made for you
Like it was made for you
It was made for you

Tell me something, something that can move me
T-tell me lies and I swear you're gonna lose me
Like an ocean jealous of the fish
It feeds you devotion, swimming inside of me

Can you feel all the love?
(Everybody wants to make it, it's all yours)
Can you feel all the love?
(Everybody wants to make it, it's all yours)
You feel all the love?
(Everybody wants to make it, it's all yours)
Can you feel all the love?
(Everybody wants to make it, it's all yours)

Like it was made for you
Like it was made for you
Like it was made for you
It was made for you

Can you feel
Can you feel
Can you feel

All the right friends in all the right places
All the right moves in all the right faces
All the right friends in all the right places
All the right moves and all the right flaces
(Can you feel all the love?)
All the right friends in all the right places
(Can you feel all the love?)
All the right moves in all the right faces
(Feel all the love)
All the right friends in all the right places
(Can you feel all the love?)
All the right moves and all the right faces

(Talking)


All the right friends in all the right places
All the right moves and all the right faces
Ooh, oh, we're going down---Lyrics submitted by adam.
