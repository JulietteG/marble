I saw your face stuck in a crowd
Silently screaming out loud
I felt the beat echo your heart
Throw me a line 'cause it's too far

All that you want, all that you see
All that you thought that you believe
Is it enough; do you think it's too much?
You say you only trust what you can touch
All you've got to do is reach out for it

All that you want os standing right in front of you
All that you need is love
All that you want is standing right in front of you
All that you need is love

Walked to the ledge, put up my hands
Scared to the bones of where I'd land
Traded my fears, traded my faults
They disappeared behind your walls

All that I want, all that I need
All that I thought I believed
Wasn't enough, you're not too much
Now you're the only thing that I can trust
All I've got to do is reach out for it

All that you want is standing right in front of you
All that you need is love
All that you want is standing right in front of you
All that you need is love

It's all for you
It's all for you---Lyrics submitted by Rachael.
