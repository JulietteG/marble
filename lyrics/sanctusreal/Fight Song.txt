[Intro]
I'm sorry for what I said about you
Will you accept my apology
I am sorry

[Verse 1]
Hey now what am I to do
I'd better think twice before I make my move
'Cause last time I didn't think it through
Don't know where it's gonna go
Don't know what we're gonna do

And hey now what am I to say
My foolish words got in the way 
Of us being friends
Wake up, make up, can't we get along again

[Chorus 1]
I don't really wanna fight over something
It's really nothing, it doesnt matter
I don't really wanna scar your heart with words that hurt you
I won't hurt you

[Verse 2]
And did you feel alright
When you hung me out to dry
Everybody knew when you put in on the 6 o'clock story on the Nightly News
Now it's turned to fake
Through this mess of words we made 
'Cause times are hard to take
Powerfuls, politics, sharper than a razor pain

[Chorus 2]
Did you really wanna fight over something
It's really nothing; it doesn't matter
Did you really wanna scar my heart with words that hurt me
Don't hurt me
I dont really wanna cry over issues 
Wet tissues stick to my shoes
Can't take back words we've spoken
But I'm hopin' you'll forgive me

[Bridge]
I don't care about what you said about me
Could we agree to disagree..
I am sorry

[Chorus 2]
Did you really wanna fight over something
It's really nothing; it doesn't matter
Do you really wanna scar my heart with words that hurt me
Don't hurt me
I dont really wanna cry over issues 
Wet tissues stick to my shoes
Can't take back words we've spoken
But I'm hopin' you'll forgive me

I'm hopin' you'll forgive me
I'm hopin' you'll forgive me---Lyrics submitted by Rachel.
