Rain falls outside
I think the sky must know whats happening tonight
Children born while fathers die
It's the circle of life that we all live in time

We've been friends for a long, long time
So if you can't talk, just cry
And know that we can talk on the other side

It's bitter cold outside
But the sun still shines 'cause we can feel it
Benjamin, you mark the life that was left behind
We see him in your eyes

And we will be friends for a long, long time
So until you can talk, just cry
And know that we will be friends for the rest of our lives

He gives and he takes, and it makes us stronger---Lyrics submitted by Alyssa.
