So early morning when you come to me 
Comfort me 
Stop rewind and... 
Play back that melody 
No early warning when You come to me 
Comfort me 
I don't know 'cause i've been told 
I just believe 

We don't want to work 'cause it never works out 
We don't want to talk 'cause words 
Get around 

All i want is to 
Bring it back to love 
I've got, you've got, we've gotta give it to 
The one who made me 

So sweetly coming back to memory 
Done for me 
I've got something that they won't believe 

But we don't want to come 
'cause we'll never come around 
We don't want to love 
'cause we never learned how 

All You have is all i need 
All You have has set me free---Lyrics submitted by Alyssa.
