I'm as eloquent as an elephant
Bought as headstrong as the Mighty King Kong
On a rampage throwing airplanes
I can't believe you haven't gone away
Gone away

I'm difficult, argumentative
Bought as thick skulled as the dinosaur bones on a Display in a glass case
I can't believe you haven't run away
Run away

[Chorus:]
It must be different through your eyes
'Cause you look at me like it's the first time
The first time
That you've ever seen my face

I'm preoccupied with a crowded mind
I get off track like a train rolling back to the future
Never too sure 
Who'll be here when I come back around
But I'm finding out

[Chorus:]
It must be different through your eyes
'Cause you look at me like it's the first time
The first time
That you've ever seen my face---Lyrics submitted by Alyssa.
