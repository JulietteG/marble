It's time for healing, 
Time to move on,
It's time to fix what's bee broken too long
Time to make right what has been wrong;
It's time to find my way to where I belong

There's a wave that's crashing down on me,
And all I can do is surrender

Whatever you're doing inside of me
It feels like chaos, but somehow there's peace
And it's hard to surrender to what I can't see,
But I'm giving in to something heavenly

Time for a milestone,
Time to begin again,
Re-evaluate who I really am
Am I doing everything to follow your will or
Just aimlessly climbing over these hills?

So show me what it is you want from me
I give everything - I surrender

To whatever you're doing inside of me
It feels like chaos, but somehow there's peace
Though it's hard to surrender to what I can't see,
But I'm giving in to something heavenly,
Something heavenly

Time to face up,
Clean this old house,
Time to breathe in and let everything out
That I've wanted to say for so many years
Time to release all my held back tears

Whatever you're doing inside of me
It feels like chaos, but I believe...

You're up to something bigger than me
Larger than life, something heavenly
Whatever you're doing inside of me
It feels like chaos, but now I can see
This is something bigger than me
Larger than life
Something heavenly, something heavenly

Time to face up,
Clean this old house,
Time to beathe in and let everything out---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
