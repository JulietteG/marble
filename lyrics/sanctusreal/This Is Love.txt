You were made to be more than a religious man
Walking through this foreign land
You do not taste, touch, or even feel
Just in case you become the very thing you fear

But don't you know that in love
No fear can rest, all fear must run
So what you feel alone it proves
That you forget what He called you to do

That is love
Oh this is love

It heals the brokenhearted
It sets the captives free
It walks an extra mile
Even for your enemies

This is love
Oh this is love

Not to judge, and nor debate
To ponder questions as the world burns at our feet
You speak of freedom but you never felt free
Oh, you simple man, don't you know what love means

It heals the brokenhearted
It sets the captives free
It walks an extra mile
Even for your enemies
It moves every mountain
Swallows up the sea
Searches every corner
Finding you and me

This is love
This is love
Oh this is love
Oh this is love

This is love for the broken, and love for the lost
Love for the scarred, and love paid the cost
Love like an ocean, an ocean so wide
You can swim in it forever lost in its tide

This is love
This is love
This is love
This is love

It heals the brokenhearted
It sets the captives free
It walks an extra mile
Even for your enemies

This is love---
