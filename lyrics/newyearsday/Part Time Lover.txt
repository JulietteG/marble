My dear,
Take what you want from me
I'll give you anything
Just don't leave me on my own
Desperate and destitute
A shadow of the former self I knew.

Take what you want from me
I'll give you anything
It's so pathetic
I make myself sick
I can't get over you
I can't get over any of this.

My dear,
Is this really happening?
Do these tears mean anything?
How could you leave me on my own?
Desperate and destitute
These seconds feel like lifetimes without you.

Take what you want from me
I'll give you anything
It's so pathetic - I make myself sick
I can't get over you
I can't get over any of...---Lyrics submitted by Tracy.
