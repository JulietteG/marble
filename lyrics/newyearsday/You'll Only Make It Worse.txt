I'm sorry that I loved you,
I'm sorry that I cared,
I'm sorry that I played the games you did,
They never got us anywhere.
I'm sorry if this hurts you,
I'm sorry I just lied,
The truth is, I don't care if you get hurt or not,
For all the tears you've made me cry

I should have known we'd never get anywhere,
Can't fall in love when you're falling apart,
Can't make amends if you're only making mistakes,
And empty words can't fix a broken heart

If the world froze over and everybody died,
And you and I were the only ones alive,
I'd say, "I'm sorry you made it, it's more then you deserve,
Don't try to make it better, you'll only make it worse"

I'm sorry that you miss me,
I'm sorry I don't care,
I was just a crutch for your loneliness,
Your heart was never really there,
I'm sorry that I wasted so much of my time,
time I could have spent with someone else would have meant,
Less of you and all your lies.

I should have known we'd never get anywhere,
Can't fall in love when you're falling apart,
Can't make amends if you're only making mistakes,
And empty words can't fix a broken heart

If the world froze over and everybody died,
And you and I were the only ones alive,
I'd say, "I'm sorry you made it, it's more then you deserve,
Don't try to make it better, you'll only make it worse"

If the world froze over and everybody died,
And you and I were the only ones alive,
I'd say, "I'm sorry you made it, it's more then you deserve,
Don't try to make it better, you'll only make it worse"

You'll only make it,
You'll only make it worse

If the world froze over,
And only I survived,
I'd sing these words at your funeral,
"It's good to be alive!"

If the world froze over and everybody died,
And you and I were the only ones alive,
I'd say, "I'm sorry you made it, it's more then you deserve,
Don't try to make it better, you'll only make it worse"

If the world froze over and everybody died,
And you and I were the only ones alive,
I'd say, "I'm sorry you made it, it's more then you deserve,
Don't try to make it better, you'll only make it worse"

I'd say, "I'm sorry you made it, it's more then you deserve...you'll only make it worse"---Lyrics submitted by andrew.
