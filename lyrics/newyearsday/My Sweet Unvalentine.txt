You leave me like an addict, always wanting more
But when I break free the sirens sounds and call me back to shore
The bottom of the ocean is the safest place to be
I still swim towards the surface just to breathe your misery

I get so lost and so confused, I'm just so tired of bein' used
I wish you'd just make up your mind, my sweet unvalentine
I'm just so tired and so afraid that you might leave me everyday
I wish you'd just make up your mind, my sweet unvalentine

You run just like a rabbit, and I chase you like a fool
But this fool I hate, I can't forsake, this fools in love with you
I'm I wasting my time, hanging by your threads?
Make up your mind, cut these spider webs

I get so lost and so confused, I'm just so tired of bein' used
I wish you'd just make up your mind, my sweet unvalentine
I'm just so tired and so afraid that you might leave me everyday
I wish you'd just make up your mind, my sweet unvalentine

Say that you'll be mine
Cut me with your sweet caress, kill me with your tenderness
I don't care what you do, as long as I'm with you

The bottom of the ocean is the safest place to be
I still swim towards the surface just to breathe your misery

I get so lost and so confused, I'm just so tired of bein' used
I wish you'd just make up your mind, my sweet unvalentine
I'm just so tired and so afraid that you might leave me everyday
I wish you'd just make up your mind, my sweet unvalentine (2x)---Lyrics submitted by kate.
