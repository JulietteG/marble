Get out of the car, and don't try and stop me
Stay where you are, 'cause there you can't hurt me
You took things too far, and I don't deserve this

You said that you'd be, you'd always be honest
And mean what you say, but you broke every promise
That you ever made, and I don't deserve this

If I had just one bullet, and a trigger I'd pull it
Shoot my cupid out of the sky
Break off his wings, and gouge out his eyes
And thank him for nothing, 'cause that's all that he gave to me
Your love is my heart disease

Don't try and call, I'm not going to answer
I'm not going to fall for another disaster
That you put me through, and I don't deserve this
No I don't deserve this.

If I had just one bullet, and a trigger I'd pull it
Shoot my cupid out of the sky
Break off his wings and gouge out his eyes
And thank him for nothing, 'cause that's all that he gave to me
Your love is my heart disease
Shoot my cupid out of the sky
Break off his wings and gouge out his eyes
And thank him for nothing, 'cause that's all that he gave to me
Your love is my heart disease

I don't care anymore
About You.
Because without you I'm better off.

Shoot my cupid out of the sky
Break off his wings and gouge out his eyes
And thank him for nothing, 'cause that's all that he gave to me
Your love is my heart disease
Shoot my cupid out of the sky
Break off his wings and ask him just why
He played such a sick joke on the fool that is me
And curse me with this sickness
Your love is my heart disease.---Lyrics submitted by alvie.
