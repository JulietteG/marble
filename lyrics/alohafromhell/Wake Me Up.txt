Wake me up
This pain is just too real
The fear is destroying me

A boy, a girl loved each other
I loved so true
She thought she'd love him forever
He talks so smooth
She heard him say:"Love you always. Forever stay."
Now she wakes up, tired
It's a sound of a babyre Days

She's all alone and he is gone

Wake me up
This pain is just too real
The fear is destroying me
Wake me up
This pain is just too real
The fear is destroying me

Now fear is strong and controls her
What will she do?
She is afraid, so afraid for the future

She tries to hide
Her tears inside

Wake me up
This pain is just too real
The fear is destroying me
Wake me up
This pain is just too real
The fear is destroying me

One life, it's yours
Don't fake it
Nightmares don't last
Just take it
We are so young
I know you
One lie is strong
Stay true, too

Wake me up
Wake me up
This pain is just too real
The fear is destroying me
Wake me up
This pain is just too real
The fear is destroying me
Wake me up---Lyrics submitted by Kari.
