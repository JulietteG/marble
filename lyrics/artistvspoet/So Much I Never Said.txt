Whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh

You packed me up and sent me off
I thought you might be angry
The world was dark and it was cold
No I don't know this city

Not giving up 
Impatiently
I'm at terminal 2 waiting by gate 3
Wont you come back? 
Just for my sake
Cause what we had can't be replaced
Everyone has somewhere to go

How am I gonna make my way back home? 
Its bad enough
Stranded in a different time zone
What happened to us? 
Round and round, it never ends
And you don't come back
There's so much, so much I never said

Whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh

I thought I herd them say your name
On the overhead loudspeaker

The time has past
That was yesterday
This place is overwhelming 

Its sinking in gradually 
That you're not coming back for me
All these high hopes weigh heavily
Feels like an eternity

No one else was left alone

How am I gonna make my was back home?
Its bad enough
Stranded in a different time zone
What happened to us? 
Round and round, it never ends
And you don't come back 
There's so much, so much I never said

Whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh. whoa oh oh oh

I feel so lost 
Is this terminal? 

How am I gonna make my way back home? 
Its bad enough
Stranded in a different time zone
What happened to us? 
Round and round, it never ends
And you don't come back
There's so much, so much I never said

How am I gonna make my way back home? 
Its bad enough
Stranded in a different time zone
What happened to us? 
Round and round, it never ends
And you don't come back
There's so much, so much I never said

Whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh

So much I never said.---
