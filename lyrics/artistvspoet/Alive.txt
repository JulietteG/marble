The night has come again,
And still, I am alone.
This time more than ever.
A feeling I had never felt before
And I don't want to remember.
It's taking a hold of me now
You drove in town to see me,
But you turned into a messenger
Oh, with news I never thought would hit my ears.
It's now numbing me inside
Me from this life and I,
Want so badly to disappear.

Maybe someday I can stand again.
Maybe soon, I can learn to wash my hands of this and start a new.
But I need you now to mend my heart
Because you're the only one that can keep me alive tonight. (tonight [x5])

You're everything to me
My whole world, entire being,
The one thing I hold true in my life.
What made you do this to me?
Did you want me to set you free?
It tears me up inside, every night.

Maybe someday I can stand again.
Maybe soon, I can learn to wash my hands of this and start a new.
But I need you now to mend my heart
Because you're the only one who can keep me alive tonight.

And everything will be just fine.
(I just wanted to be perfect, I just wanted to be perfect)
And everything will be just fine.
(I just wanted to be perfect, I just wanted to be perfect)

Maybe someday I can stand again. (and everything will be just fine)
Maybe soon, I can learn to wash my hands of this and start anew.
But I need you now to mend my heart (and everything will be just fine)
Because you're the only one that can keep me alive tonight.---
