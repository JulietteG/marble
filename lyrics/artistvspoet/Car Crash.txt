(Ba da da da dada)
(ba da da da dada, da da)
(ba da da da dada)
(ba da da da dada, da da)

What's it gonna take to wake me up
From this black hole I've been living in?
I see my body shake, it's tensing up
My vitals won't be givin' in.

Wake me up.

(Whoo-ooh) I've found what I've been missin' lately.
(Whoo-ooh) It's the reason why my heart's been racing.
It took a car crash to turn it around,
I've figured it out- that I don't have it down.
(Whoo-ooh) I gotta get my feet back on the ground.

(ba da da da dada)
(ba da da da dada, da da)
This isn't at all what I expected-
To be stranded, drifting all alone.
How can I stay cool, calm, and collected
When my world's been turned and overthrown?

All I can remember was the brake lights flashing,
The sound of the crash, and gasping for air.
It begs the question:
Is this the end?
My last impression:
The end of the world.

Wake me up.

(Whoo-ooh) I've found what I've been missin' lately.
(Whoo-ooh) It's the reason why my heart's been racing.
It took a car crash to turn it around,
I've figured it out- that I don't have it down.
(Whoo-ooh) I gotta get my feet back on the ground.

The lights and sounds,
They are getting closer now.
As they surround,
I realize I will make it out.
And as they pull me from the wreckage,
The stretcher's coming, it's just what I need.

Wake me up.
And it's obvious...

(Whoo-ooh) I've found what I've been missin' lately.
(Whoo-ooh) It's the reason why my heart's been racing.
It took a car crash to turn it around,
I've figured it out- that I don't have it down.
(It took a car crash to turn it around.)
(Whoo-ooh) I've found what I've been missin' lately.
(Whoo-ooh) It's the reason why my heart's been racing.
It took a car crash to turn it around,
I've figured it out- that I don't have it down.
(It took a car crash to turn it around.)
(Whoo-ooh) I finally get my feet back on the ground.
