So am i wrong to make believe
that she's divine in all the flawless ways that she
cuts me back down to size?
her sarcastic tongue only fuels the fire
don't get me wrong 'cause i believe she's an affliction that i need
her sweet bitter words don't phase me
those little white lies are intoxicating

i lost a step and i'm falling into you
you know exactly what you do

she's adorable as hell
she's got me begging on my knees
la da da da da - i'm so into it
she's adorable as hell
she's got me begging on my knees
la da da da da - i'm so into it

i'm powerless and she's well rehearsed
her sober chorus undermines my wasted verse
unexpected and defeated
i never thought i'd get off being mistreated
i won't take for granted
her picturesque letter perfect silhouette
her red hot short fuse attracts me
i've lost all control 'cause she's so distracting

i tripped up and i'm falling into you
you know exactly what you do

she's adorable as hell
she's got me begging on my knees
la da da da da - i'm so into it
she's adorable as hell
she's got me begging on my knees
la da da da da - i'm so into it

i try to save the better days with you
in the back of my mind
but focus on the bitter words you choose
they send chills down my spine

i took a chance and i'm falling into you
you know exactly what you do

she's adorable as hell
she's got me begging on my knees
la da da da da - i'm so into it
she's adorable as hell
she's got me begging on my knees
la da da da da - i'm so into it---Lyrics submitted by Zoey.
