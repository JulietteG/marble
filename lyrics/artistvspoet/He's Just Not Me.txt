He's just not me,
And he never will be.
And he buys nice things,
But what we had was free.

So tell me I'm wrong-
Tell me that you've been missing somethin' all along.
So when will you see,
See that you're so completely better off with me?

Tell me:
When you're alone, is that when you know
That you're making the greatest mistake?
You're falling in love, and it's not enough
And you know that your heart's gonna break.
And it shows, that you're not meant to be
'Cause he's just not me. (not me, not me, not me, not me)

He'll make, it seem
That your life is like a dream.
But money isn't everything,
With a promise left empty.

So what do you think,
Now that you're drowning in the bottom of your drink?
And do you believe
That you were so completely better off with me?

So tell me:
When you're alone, is that when you know
That you're making the greatest mistake?
You're falling in love, and it's not enough
And you know that your heart's gonna break.
And it shows, that you're not meant to be
'Cause he's just not me.

There's somethin' missin' inside me I can't ignore.
And I can't stand to see you with someone else anymore.
I'm on your side (on your side)
It's time we tried...

When you're alone, is that when you know
That you're making the greatest mistake?
You're falling in love, and it's not enough
And you know that your heart's gonna break.
And it shows, that you're not meant to be
'Cause he's just not me. (not me)
(When you're alone, is that when you know?)
'Cause he's just not me (not me)
(You're falling in love, and it's not enough)
He's just not me.---Lyrics submitted by Zoey.
