I'm losin' my edge,
Reflection's turned to white- like a ghost that's in the mirror,
It keeps haunting me tonight.
And as I lose my self-control, (lose my self control)
(I become a disaster)
Into the unknown
(I move a little faster)

You know that in the end, 
(You're my favorite)
I'll relapse again. 
(You're my favorite)
I'm down to my own tricks,
You're my favorite fix. (fix, fix, fix...)

When I come down, I can't replace the feeling
Of falling to my knees and I'm sweatin' 'cause I'm fiendin'- I need it.
As I lost my self-control (lost my self-control)
(It's self-defeating)
It's left me all alone
(And now I know reason)

You know that in the end, 
(you're my favorite)
I'll relapse again. 
(you're my favorite)
I'm down to my own tricks,
You're my favorite fix. (fix, fix, fix, fix....)

I come to grips that I have fallen in so deep.
There's no resisting to what pulls me out of reach.
I am a victim, a product of an addiction.
Locked in this system and there's no escape.

You know that in the end, 
(You're my favorite)
I'll relapse again. 
(You're my favorite)
I'm down to my own tricks,
You're my favorite fix.
You know that in the end, 
(You're my favorite)
I'll relapse again. 
(You're my favorite)
I'm down to my own tricks...
I'm down to my own tricks,
You're my favorite fix---Lyrics submitted by Zoey.
