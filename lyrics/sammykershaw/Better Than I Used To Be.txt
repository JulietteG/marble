I know how to hold a grudge, I can send a bridge up in smoke .
I cant count the people I've let down or the hearts I've broke.
 You aint gota dig to deep if you wanna  find some dirt on me..
But I'm learnin who you've been aint who you've gota be. 
its gona be an uphill climb,ahh honey I wont lie..

I aint no angel,but I've been sitting out a few more dances with the devil,
 and cleaning up my act little by little.
 I'm gettin there.I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see.
I aint as good as I'm gona get but I'm better than I used to be...


I've pinn alot of demons to the ground,gota alot of old habits licked .
but theres still one or two I might need you to help me kick, 
Standing in the rain so long has left me with a little rust ,
But put some faith in me someday you'll see theres a diamond under all this dust ..

I aint no angel,but I've been sitting out a few more dances with the devil,
 and cleaning up my act little by little Im gettin there.
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see..
I aint as good as I'm gona get but im better than I used to be...

I aint no angel,but I've been sitting out a few more dances with the devil,
and cleaning up my act little by little Im gettin there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see.
I aint as good as i'm gona get but I'm better than I used to be...
ohhh lord I'm better than I used to be.---Lyrics submitted by Vianna.
