So many ways I want to tell you, the way I feel for you
Night and day Im thinking of you, because my aim is true
Lost inside the rhythm, crazy for the love of you
Its all I ever wanted. Babe youve got to know its true
I couldnt love you more, I couldnt love you more
I couldnt love you more, baby I couldnt love you more

Cant contemplate a life without you, without the things you do
Every day my heart sings for you, for lifes a dream come true
I found a road to freedom, all because the love of you
Its all I ever wanted, baby youve got to know its true
I couldnt love you more, I couldnt love you more
I couldnt love you more, I couldnt love you more

From the beginning it was plain for me to see
You were the one, the one for me
It would have hurt so much if it was not to be
You were the one, the only one
I couldnt love you more, I couldnt love you more
I couldnt love you more, couldnt love you more
So many ways, all of my dreams, babe I want to tell you
Night and day, day and night, I couldnt love you more---
