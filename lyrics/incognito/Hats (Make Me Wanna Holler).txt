You see them on the jazz cats, dancing to the hi hats
They wear them at the races, and graduating places
The people at the lido, wear them on the lie low
It is a must for the cowboys, city guys drivin in their toys

I got a hat for the rain, a hat full of rain
Got a hat that would take you back
I got a hat for the sun some just for fun
Hats are where its at
I got a hat with my name, one for the game
Another for the open sky
I got one thats tall, one for the fall
And I tilt it when you pass me by

Lookin good baby, lookin real fine
Lookin good baby, so fine I want to make you mine
Makes me wanna holler
Make me wanna shout

Theres a sailor with a boater, a tailor with a bowler
Glamour girls on the beaches, as Halloween bewitches
On the streets of Durban bucket hats and turbans
The manor bride birdcage is causing quite an outrage---
