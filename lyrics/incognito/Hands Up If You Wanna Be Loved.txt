Hands up if you wanna be loved
Hands up cos we wanna be loved

Walk me through it, Ill talk you through it, blindfolded through the mine-field
Holler at me, Ill holler back, unflustered through the changes
Now put your hands up
Hands up if you wanna be loved
Hands up cos we wanna be loved
Hands up if you wanna be loved
Everybody sing yeah
Hands up if you wanna be loved
Hands up cos we wanna be loved
Hands up if you wanna feel love

It feels so right, to be reaching out for you
A feeling so good, when youre reaching out to me
We do what it takes, cos we wanna be loved
Theres no denyin, we got it all yall
We got it all yall. We got it all yall. Weve got it all

Glad youre back here, I gotcha back now
Intrusted, we got it pat down
Put it on me, Ill give it to you back
Upgraded to the top line

Hands up if you wanna be loved
Hands up cos we wanna feel love
Hands up if you wanna be loved
Lets get it on, get it on---
