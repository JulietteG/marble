Where along the line did you get off the track
Thinking the life you're living is where it's at
Don't you feel discontent inside
There's something about you life just cannot hide
They say home is where your heart is
But I say it's in your peace of mind
If you go home to yourself
Happiness you've got to find

Ain't it time you went home. Ain't it time you went home
Ain't it time you went home. Ain't it time you went home
Going home, going home

Facing the truth is the first move to make
Then love and dreams are yours to take
There'll be no love lest you give it
Dreams will be dreams until you live them
Strong belief with a strong pursuit
Is the latest combination to see you through
You be your own master double-denim strong
You wonder how you stayed away from home so long---Lyrics submitted by nimantha pera.
