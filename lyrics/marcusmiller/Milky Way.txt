(...) Wait a minute (...)

Everywhere I go,
Everyone I know, is searching
For some kind of answer

Stars are shining by
They decorate the night, in Gemini,
Sagittarius and Cancer

Somewhere out there,
A mysterious form of light is awaiting
They're gonna save us, make us famous
And we wont have to feel so all alone

Out on the edge of the the milky way
Far from the paradise, going to school, serving time
On the edge of the the milky way
Dropped us off, and left us here
Smoking up the atmosphere

Lots of boys and girls
Living in this world are thinking
We need to go faster

We're picking up the pace
In the human race
We don't worry about disaster

(...) don't worry babe (...)

Somewhere in there,
An important part of our collected brain is missing
Is outrageous, like las vegas
We are all together, but we are all alone

Out on the edge of the the milky way
Far from the paradise, going to school, serving time
On the edge of the the milky way
Dropped us off, left us here
Smoking up, the atmosphere
Please,

Can somebody tell me,

Where is everybody going

(...) Wait a minute (...)
Somewhere out there
Come on back and save us
Maybe they'll, come on back
We are going to paradise, (???)
Welcome to the penitentiary
The ultimate place to live your life
In paradise or misery

I keep on edge of the the milky way
Far from the paradise, going to school, serving time
On the edge of the the milky way
Dropped us off, and left us here
Smoking up, the atmosphere
On the edge of the the milky way
Far from the paradise, going to school, serving time
On the edge of the the milky way
The drop is off, left us here
Smoking up, the atmosphere

With no possible way of making a connection,
Oh Yeah

Come on back, maybe they'll save us
Savers from ourselves,
Oh Yeah---Lyrics submitted by Juan.
