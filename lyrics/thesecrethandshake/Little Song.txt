I've been tryna write a song about you
I've been trying here but no such luck
I've been tryna write a song that describes
Just how much
I need you tonight
And I've been workin at this song for ages
I wanted to make sure it came out right
I hope that it shows how things really are here
And how I am
Feeling more

I wanna write
The soundtrack to your life
And live it with you (with you)
I wanna write
The soundtrack to your life
And live it with you (with you)
With you

So first I started with a simple beat and
I even added a piano tune
But then I had to think of words that describe
The things I really wanna sing to you
Oh

So now I'm working on this melody and
I think that I could add a harmony
I just want for the song to come together
Then maybe you'd see what you mean to me

I wanna write
The soundtrack to your life
And live it with you (with you)
I wanna write
The soundtrack to your life
And live it with you (with you)
With you

I wanna write
The soundtrack to your life
And live it with you (with you)
I wanna write
The soundtrack to your life
And live it with you (with you)
With you

So baby just remember
As this song hits your ears
I'm tryna turn the way I feel for you
Into something that you can hear
But how can words in music explain what love is
Nothing I could sing would ever do it justice
And I don't know where to start
I just want you to hear the song in my heart
Oh

I wanna write
The soundtrack to your life
And live it with you (with you)
I wanna write
The soundtrack to your life
And live it with you (with you)
With you

I wanna write
The soundtrack to your life
And live it with you (with you)
I wanna write
The soundtrack to your life
And live it with you (with you)
With you---Lyrics submitted by Sienna.
