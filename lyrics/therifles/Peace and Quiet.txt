I don't see how another day is gonna make us change our minds,
So why don't we go separate ways and save us a bit of time,
We can't go on trying living behind this worn out and thin disguise,
I don't want to try talking it out and I don't need another fight,
It just won't work when,

All I want is a little peace and quiet(x2)

I just don't want to live this way cos lately we've been up all night,
I can't speak free when you're in my face and I don't like to be unkind,
You constantly try and turn it round when clearly it's black and white,
Something's gone and now I'm feeling down cos I've been here a million times,
It just won't work when,

All I want is a little peace and quiet(x2)

We can't go on trying living behind this worn out and thin disguise,
I don't want to try talking it out and I don't need another fight, 
It just won't work when,

All I want is a little peace and quiet(x2)

It's been so long since I had a lover,
Here I stand alone without another,
It's been so long since I had a lover,
Here I stand alone without another,
Now I'm alone.---Lyrics submitted by James.
