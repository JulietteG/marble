Jimmy was a local boy but he's seen much more than a change in the weather,
Sitting in a uniform of a three piece suit and the ribbons from his past,
Looking through the little boy at the bar with the mouth who thinks he's clever,
Now dreaming of the day that he got home from a war to his childhood sweetheart.

Now he don't need anyone,
There's no one there for him,
Just the feeling of an empty place deteriorating.

Jimmy was a local boy but he's seen much more than I'm bound to ever,
A member of a dying breed that has sat in wait as it all just falls apart,
Dreaming of a day that's oh so long ago he can't remember right,
There was a time a man could still be a man and be proud to use his heart.

Now he don't need anyone,
There's no one there for him,
There was really only one now he misses how she sounds.

He frowns, line em up and he puts them down,
It's sad, this town seems to fail to appreciate the man.

Now he don't need anyone,
There's no one there for him,
No he don't feel anymore cos Jimmy's so thick skinned,
And a long long time ago when he could break a heart,
There was really only one now he misses how she sounds,
He frowns, line em up and he puts them down,
It's sad, this town seems to fail to appreciate the man.---Lyrics submitted by James.
