The days of old and all the stories from our shores
Have gone away and  won't return for evermore for
A brand new craze around thats makin all the waves
It teaches you how not to act and how not to behave now

Tell me why should I turn away my eyes?
From where I reside to only find that all my time is wasted

Theyre not ever gonna listen not until you react
So perhaps there is science in violence
I dont ever want to listen to all that outside of my door
So am I at the wrong?

The walk to home at night's an everlasting trial
Take the bus but still they constantly remind
Yes its nice a little music
But do I want to hear the songs you like?

Tell me why should I turn away my eyes from where I reside?
To only find that all my time is wasted

Theyre not ever gonna listen
Not until you react, so perhaps there is science in violence
I dont ever want to listen to all that
Outside at my door,
So am I at the wrong?

The world is ours and ours alone
The world is ours and ours alone

Theyre not ever gonan listen not until you react
So perhaps there is science in violence
I dont ever want to listen
And its a fact that what the body dont hear the body will fill for sure

The world is ours and ours alone
The world is ours and ours alone
The world is ours and ours alone---Lyrics submitted by James.
