Today could be the day we might make a change,
So lock yourself indoors and plan a getaway,
Take a walk outside in the heavy weather,
The British summertimes just great whatever,
Join a local gang and get a cool nickname,
Make your lifelong sweetheart your ball and chain,
Convert your self belief for a new religion,
Or leave the TV on make your decision when you're...

Waiting for the day you're not looking for something else, for something else.

Go put your last five pound on the lottery,
If you're not in it to win it well then you won't receive,
And maybe place all your winnings on an outsider,
And if it wins you'll be grinning and you can celebrate,
Six months of our lives are at a red light,
And there's a thousand chances to get it right,
So put your foot in the door because its free admission,
Or leave the TV on make your own decision when you're...

Waiting for the day you're not looking for something else, for something else...

Break away your ties and find a new squeeze,
Show a local scheme your genorousity,
Stand back in the shadows and be a right hand man,
Buy a brand new semi next door to the taliban,
Who knows what's around the bend?
Stay up, get drunk with all your best friends,
Celebrate your side to a new division,
or leave the TV on make you're own decision when you're...

Waiting for the day and not looking for something else, for something else

Don't let your day grow long before it comes a week,
Go and make a change before the big sleep---Lyrics submitted by James.
