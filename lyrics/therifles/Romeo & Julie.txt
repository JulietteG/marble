Windy walks and days in bed
All our differences unsaid
Hand in hand we both entwine
Underneath a dreary grey skyline

And all we think about is that someday we might
Have more to think about and less time to decide
But if time is on our side then tell me why

We have to fall apart, and go around again
I don't know where to start because we never end
We could be Romeo and Julie of our time
If we could only hide the tears we have to cry

Windy walks and days in bed
All our differences unsaid
Hand in hand we both entwine
Underneath a dreary grey skyline

And all we think about is that someday we might
Have more to think about and less time to decide
But if time is on our side then tell me why

We have to fall apart, and go around again
I don't know where to start because we never end
We could be Romeo and Julie of our time
If we could only see the differences from a heartache and a lie
So don't tell me that's the end cause that's the lie

The difference between a heartache and a lie.---Lyrics submitted by James.
