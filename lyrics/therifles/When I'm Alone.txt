Every time I catch your eye in the streetlights late at night when I walk you home,
I hate to think that you're not mine,
So then I try to make you feel that I don't want you,
I don't want to go down that road we always get in a big fight,
It happens all the time,
So when I say that I'm just your friend and I'm willing to try,
Well then I won't carry on pretending it's all a lie,
Cos I smile when you're there but I cry when I'm all alone,
But it's far too hard to say to you don't go, don't go.

Every time I hear your voice down the phoneline late at night when you're feeling low,
And you're telling me to come home,
It happens all the time,
So when I say that I'm just you're friend and I'm willing to try,
Well then I won't carry on pretending it's all a lie,
Cos I smile when you're there but I cry when I'm all alone,
But it's far too hard to say to you don't go, don't go.

Yeah I smile when you're there but I cry when I'm all alone,
But it's far to hard to say to you don't go, don't go(x2)---Lyrics submitted by James.
