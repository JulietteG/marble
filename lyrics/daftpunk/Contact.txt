Hey Bob Im looking at what Jack was talking about and its definitely not a particle thats nearby. It is a bright object and its obviously rotating because its flashing, its way out in the distance, certainly rotating in a very rhythmic fashion because the flashes come around almost on time. As we look back at the earth its up at about 11 oclock, about maybe ten or twelve diameters. I dont know whether that does you any good, but theres something out there.---
