[Verse 1]
Driving this road down to paradise,
Letting the sunlight into my eyes
Our only plan is to improvise

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's crystal clear that I don't ever want it to end
If I had my way, I would never leave
Keep building these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay...

[Chorus]
I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go, these moments will shine
I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go, these moments will shine

[Verse 2]
Familiar faces I've never seen
Living the gold and the silver dream
Making me feel like I'm 17

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Synthesizer Solos]

[Outro]
I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go, these moments will shine
I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
These moments will shine---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
