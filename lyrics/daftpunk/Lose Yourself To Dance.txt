(feat. Pharrell Williams)

I know you don't get chance to take a break this often
I know your life is speeding and it isn't stopping
Here take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe up all the
Sweat, sweat, sweat

Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance

Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance

Lose yourself to dance

I know you don't get chance to take a break this often
I know your life is speeding and it isn't stopping
Here take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe up all the
Sweat, sweat, sweat

Lose yourself to dance (Come on)

Everybody dancing on the floor
Can't do any more anymore
Everybody on the floor
Yeah, come on

I know you don't get chance to take a break this often
I know your life is speeding and it isn't stopping
Here take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe up all the
Sweat, sweat, sweat

Lose yourself to dance (Come on)

Everybody dancing on the floor
Can't do any more anymore
Everybody on the floor
Yeah, come on ---
