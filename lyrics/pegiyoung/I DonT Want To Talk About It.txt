I can tell by your eyes;
That you're probably be crying for ever
And the stars in the sky don't mean nothing
To you there a mirror
I don't wanna talk about it 
How you broke my heart
If I stay here for a little bit longer
If I stay here wont you listen to my heart?
Oh my heart,,,
If I stand here all alone;
Will the shadows hide the colors of my heart?
Blue for the tears and black for the nights fears;
The stars in the sky don't mean noting to you
There a mirror
I don't wanna talk about it 
How u broke my heart
But if i stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here won't you listen to my heart?
Oh my heart...
I don't wanna talk about it how you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit  longer
If I stay here wont you listen to my heart---Lyrics submitted by leilaina.
