Sometimes when I see you my heart starts to ache and
You know I got a Krush on you
My brain gets all fuzzy and my knees start to shake and
You know I got a Krush on you

Go!!!

Then I feel dizzy and I'm sitting around and
You know I got a Krush on you
My hands are electric and my skins on fire
You know I got a Krush on you

Go!!!

My hands are shaking and my stomach starts to ache
You know I got a Krush on you
I just wanna scream and tell you how I feel cause
You know I got a Krush on you---Lyrics submitted by es.
