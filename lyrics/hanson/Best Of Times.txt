You look to me like a place I know
But I dont remember times this good
Walk down roads, kicking cans, and making plans like we used to
Youve heard my stories a thousand times
But you still laugh at every single joke
Dont need a reason to call me any time that you want to
And we laugh a little when we feel like crying
If you cry a little, I dont mind
Making it up as we go along
Three chords and the truth, we can make a song
We dont need much, cause were here tonight
It could be the best of times
Youve got places you want to go
And Ive got things I need to leave behind
So then I light fires, and kick the tires, on roads like we used to
And we laugh a little when we feel like crying
If you cry a little, I dont mind
Making it up as we go along
Three chords and the truth, we can make a song
We dont need much, cause were here tonight
It could be the best of times
Making it up as we go along
Weve got the truth, we can make a song
Making it up as we go along
Weve got the truth, we can make a song
(And it could be the best of times)
Making it up as we go along
(It could be the best of times)
Weve got the truth, we can make a song
(It could be the best of times)
Making it up as we go along
(It could be the best of times)
Weve got the truth, we can make a song
(It could be the best of times)
Making it up as we go along
(It could be the best of times)
Weve got the truth, we can make a song
Making it up as we go along
Weve got the truth, we can make a song
(It could be the best of times)
It could be the best of times---Lyrics submitted by Grant Taplin.
