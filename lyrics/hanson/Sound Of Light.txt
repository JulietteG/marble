Never been enough to be standing still
Always had a taste for another thrill
When I hit a wall, and Im put to the test
Always find it hard to ignore it
When I feel the heat Ill know Im on my way
Just a little spark that burns so bright
Ill be on my feet til I reach the day
Ill be searching, searching for the sound of light
Searching for the sound of light
Searching for the sound of light
I never feared the fire, never pined for rest
Never had a need for an empty test
There is still a light that no man has touched
Ive got to see for myself how its burning
When I feel the heat, Ill know Im on my way
Just a little spark that burns so bright
Ill be on my feet til I reach the day
Ill be searching, searching for the sound of light
Searching for the sound of light
Searching for the sound of light
Searching for the sound of light
Searching for the sound of light
I gotta hear it for you to know
Cause I just cant tell what Im searching for
Ive been searching, searching for the sound
Ive been searching, searching for the sound
Ive been searching, searching for the sound
Ive been searching, searching for the sound of light
Ive been searching, searching for the sound
Ive been searching, searching for the sound of light
Searching for the sound of light
Searching for the sound of light
Searching for the sound of light
Searching for the sound of light---Lyrics submitted by Grant Taplin.
