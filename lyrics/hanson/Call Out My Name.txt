When I first met you, I was sure
I would be ready for whats in store
Now youre becoming something more
And its so hard on me watching you go
Treat every day as the start
And youll be just fine
Nobody gonna steal your spark
If you should lose your way
Ill be right there if you
Call out my name
Deep blue eyes, golden hair
You are so beautiful people will swear
When youre walking they will stare
Cause you move like youre walking on air
Treat every day as the start
And youll be just fine
Nobody gonna steal your spark
If you should lose your way
Ill be right there if you
Call out my name
Call out my name
For now its just you and I
Soon somebody gonna find you
Gonna steal you out of my life
It aint no secret, it aint no lie
The way you smile is gonna set the world on fire
Treat every day as the start
And youll be just fine
Nobody gonna steal your spark
If you should lose your way
Ill be right there if you
Call out my name
Call out my name---Lyrics submitted by Grant Taplin.
