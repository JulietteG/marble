Without a doubt girl youre ahead of your time 
Lets go out on the town 
Give it a piece of your mind 
Youve been going round and round in your head 
So dont think twice 
Youll end up worse than youve been 

Cause I know that youve been thinkin bout it 
And I know they think youre out of your mind 
All of this time 
I know that youve been waiting for this 

So come on shout it out so everybody can hear 
Theres no need to rhyme it The message is clear 
You know I cant ignore 
So I dont know what youre waiting for 
But youre trying hard not to show it 

Cause I know that youve been thinkin bout it 
Well I know they think youre out of your mind 
All of this time 
I know that youve been waiting for this 
Come on come on 
I know that you've been waiting for this 

Can't figure out how we made it this far 
If you dont mind me sayin, 
theres no sense in waiting so 
Shout it out, shout it out 
Shout if out, shout it out 
You cant deny it, you can't deny it 

Cause I know that youve been thinkin bout it 
And I know they think youre out of your mind 
All of this time 
I know that youve been waiting so 
You can't deny 
I know that you've been waiting for this 
I know that you've been waiting for this---Lyrics submitted by Stephen.
