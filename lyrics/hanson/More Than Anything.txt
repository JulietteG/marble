I love you more than anything, than anything. I do. And I'd give anything and everything I have just to be with you. These feelings I hold inside are emotions I cannot hide. These feelings will not subside. I'd give anything. When I look into your eyes, I see something special about you. And when I hold your hand, you seem to understand that I love you more than anything. Than anything, I do. And I'd give anything and everything I have just o be with you. These feelings I hold inside are emotions I cannot hide. These feelings will not subside. I'd give anything. I'd do things that cant be done. I'd fly to the moon and then around the sun if you'll just say that I'm the one, I'd do anything. Well, I love you more than anything, than anything. I do. And I'd give anything and everything I have just to be with you. These feelings I hold inside are emotions I cannot hide. These feelings will not subside. I'd give anything. You know I'd do anything for you. I love you more than anything. Hey, hey more than anything.---Lyrics submitted by Lacey.
