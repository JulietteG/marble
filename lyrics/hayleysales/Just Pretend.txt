I've taken out the map and 
Cut it up in pieces 
Taped it back together with no space between us

With brightly coloured pencils
I jotted in some islands linked the land together
Shrinking up the ocean
I've etched a couple tunnels
Sketched a couple lines
I'm doing what I can to pass the time

'Cause I can always just pretend
Paint the picture and jump in
I can always just pretend
The world is small
It's only a mile to your door mm mmm

I've taken out the globe and measured miles and inches 
Making you feel closer
Scaling down the distance 
With that purple marker 
I've Xed up both those oceans
Nestling between us, making me lonesome
I've hung a couple signs that redirect direction
Linking up our roads with warm intersection

'Cause I can always just pretend 
Paint the picture and jump in
I can always just pretend the world is small
It's only a mile to your door
I wish i could be there
Cuddling in the back of your car
Until it is really you

I can always just pretend...
I-I can always just pretend...---Lyrics submitted by Ria C.
