Though I may speak
some tongue of old
or even spit out some holy word
I have no strength with which to speak
when you sit me down and see Im weak

We will run and scream
You will dance with me
Well fulfill our dreams, and well be free

We will run and scream
You will dance with me
Well fulfill our dreams, and well be free
We will be who we are
And theyll heal our scars 
Sadness will be far away

So I have done wrong
to put me right
my judgement burned in the black of night
Then I give less than I take
It is my fault, my own mistake 

We will run and scream
You will dance with me
Well fulfill our dreams, and well be free
We will be who we are
And theyll heal our scars 
Sadness will be far away---
