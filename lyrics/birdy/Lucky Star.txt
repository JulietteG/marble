You must be my lucky star
'Cause you shine on me wherever you are
I just think of you and I start to glow
And I need your light and baby you know

Starlight, starbright, first star I see tonight
Starlight, starbright, make everything alright
Starlight, yeah
Starlight, yeah

You must be my lucky star
'Cause you make the darkness seem so far
And when I'm lost you'll be my guide
I turn around and you're by my side

Starlight, starbright, first star I see tonight
Starlight, starbright, make everything alright
Starlight, starbright, first star I see tonight
Starlight, yeah
Starlight, yeah

Shine your heavenly body tonight
'Cause I know you're gonna make everything all right

You may be my lucky star
But I'm the luckiest by far

Starlight, starbright, first star I see tonight
Starlight, starbright, make everything alright
Starlight, yeah
Starlight, yeah---
