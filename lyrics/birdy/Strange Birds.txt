Little ghost, you are listening,
Unlike most you dont miss a thing,
You see the truth,
I walk the halls invisibly,
I climb the walls, no one sees me,
No one but you.

Youve always loved the strange birds
Now I want to fly into your world
I want to be heard
My wounded wings still beating,
Youve always loved the stranger inside
Me, ugly pretty.

Oh no, no, no, no x 3
[ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsty.com/birdy-strange-birds-lyrics.html ]
Oh little ghost, you see the pain
But together we can make something beautiful,
So take my hand and perfectly,
We fill the gaps, you mimic three,
I was meant for you, and you for me.

Youve always loved the strange birds
Now I want to fly into your world
I want to be heard
My wounded wings still beating,
Youve always loved the stranger inside
Me, ugly pretty.

Oh no, no, no, no x 3 (Repeat)

Youve always loved the strange birds
Now I want to fly into your world
I want to be heard
My wounded wings still beating,
Youve always loved the stranger inside
Me, ugly pretty.---Lyrics submitted by Laura Young.
