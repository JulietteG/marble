Times that I've seen you lose your way
You're not in control and you won't be told
All I can do to keep you safe is hold you close
Hold you close til you can breathe on your own
Til you can breathe on your own

Hold tight; you're slowly coming back to life
I'll be keeping your head up
I'll be keeping your head up, darling
Let go of all your haunted dreams tonight
I'll be keeping your head up
I'll be keeping your head up, darling
Hold tight; you're slowly coming back to life
I'll be keeping your head up
I'll be keeping your head up, darling
Let go of all your haunted dreams tonight
I'll be keeping your head up
I'll be keeping your head up
And I won't let you down

Everyone keeps a darker place
To lose control, you're not alone
And when you come looking for embrace
I know your soul; I'll be your home
Til you can breathe on your own
Til you can breathe on your own

Hold tight; you're slowly coming back to life
I'll be keeping your head up
I'll be keeping your head up, darling
Let go of all your haunted dreams tonight
I'll be keeping your head up
I'll be keeping your head up, darling
Hold tight; you're slowly coming back to life
I'll be keeping your head up
I'll be keeping your head up, darling
Let go of all your haunted dreams tonight
I'll be keeping your head up
I'll be keeping your head up
And I won't let you down

You never think that you can fly
You'll always swim against the tide
Don't you know your pain is mine?
And I would die a thousand times to ease your mind
To ease your mind

Hold tight; you're slowly coming back to life
I'll be keeping your head up
I'll be keeping your head up, darling
Let go of all your haunted dreams tonight
I'll be keeping your head up
I'll be keeping your head up, darling
Hold tight; you're slowly coming back to life
I'll be keeping your head up
I'll be keeping your head up, darling
Let go of all your haunted dreams tonight
I'll be keeping your head up
I'll be keeping your head up
And I won't let you down---
