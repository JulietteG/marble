All of my life it seemed 
that something had been missing
i didn't know what to do
Days would pass me by
each lonely as the other
until i met you
You opened the door
and let the sunshine
in my life will never be 
the same again

Now that i have you 
everything just seems so right
Now that i have you 
i'm alive
You are the song that i'll be
singing my whole life through
I'm living in a brighter world
now that i have you

Looking ahead i see
the two of us together
i'll never let you go
You're so dear to me
and it isn't any wonder
why i love you so

You opened the door
 and let the sunshine 
in my life will never be
the same again

Now that i have you
everything just seems so right
Now that i have you
i'm alive

You are the song that i'll be
singing my whole life through
I'm living in a brighter world
now that i have you

I feel this love is real
i see it in your eyes
You take my hand 
and i understand 
you are mine..
you are mine

Now that i have you
everything just seems so right
Now that i have you
I'm alive

You are the song that i'll be
singing my whole life through
I'm living in a brighter world
now that i have you...---Lyrics submitted by ehmz.
