Then came the morning
It was bright like a light
That you kept from your smile
Then came the morning
Like a flood from the storm
That you kept from my heart

Take the dog with you when you leave
Wash my hands of all this broken heave
Never forget what you thought youd never be
If you ever let me
Break the spell and try and
Leave it when we couldnt find it

Then came the morning
It was bright like a light
That you kept from your smile
Then came the morning
Like a flood from the storm
That you kept from my heart

Take my words
Breathe them out like smoke
Burn every single letter that I wrote
Let the pages turn to ash
I dont want them back
Everything you always said to me
Starts to sound like broken glass on streets
Spread it out all over places where I sleep

Now you finally left me
Done with all your lying
Joy comes in the morning
You wont see me crying

Then came the morning
It was bright like a light
That you kept from your smile
Then came the morning
Like a flood from the storm
That you kept from my heart

Then came the morning
It was lost when you left
When you took what I felt
Then came the morning
Then came the morning
Then came the morning
Then came the morning

Then the storm breaks the cold
Not towards the line I thought you stole
Start to feel what I felt way before
You broke down my front door
Popped my heart up off the wooden floor
Now I dont need your smile anymore

Then came the morning
It was bright like a light
That you kept from your smile
Then came the morning
Like a flood from the storm
That you kept from my heart

Then came the morning
Then came the morning
Then came the morning
Then came the morning
Then came the morning ---
