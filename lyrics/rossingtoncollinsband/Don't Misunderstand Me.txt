I know where you're goin', I see where you've been
Don't you know by now, you never take life on the chin
Still you sit and wonder why the past is gone
Baby, you'll go under if you don't carry on

Don't misunderstand me
I realize it ain't easy to take
But you've been hidin'
And I've been riding like the wind to find you
Just you

I don't need no promises, just tell me the truth
Mister, keep it honest, that's all I ask of you
Don't be second-guessin' 'bout where you want to be
Baby, count your blessing 'cause you won't find one like me

Don't misunderstand me
I realize it ain't easy to take
But you've been hidin'
And I've been ridin' like the wind to find you

Well now, lady, put your dress on, grab them fancy shoes
Honey, I'm ready and waiting on you
Time is surely wastin' we've so much to do
We're both too smart to be fakin'

And I know it doesn't matter which road we take
Or if it's your way or my way
Well, lady, let me tell you what we're gonna do
Uh huh
We're gonna ride every highway

Don't misunderstand me
I realize it ain't easy to take
But you've been hidin'
And I've been ridin' like the wind to find you

To find you - x4---Lyrics submitted by Jodine M Kamler.
