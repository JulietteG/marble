If we try hard enough I'm sure we could forget it
Cause this black-hearted weddings enough to start a panic
We were clean for three days when you were running down the block
11 minutes sober, now we're counting down the clock
And Donnie says, "you're the reason we are here"
And we all know that what Donnie says is true
So go to bed, this life is not a shameless waste
And we all know that's what it is to you goodnight

We will overcome every night to the sound of the kick drum
We've got it figured out every night to the sound of the break down

We can stand the street every night to the sound of the blase beat 
I feel like my worn hands are empty waiting for God's new plans

Please, darling can you lead the way
My world has flipped now I have gone astray
Now it falls apart every night to the sight of the dim stars

I take it slow because I have time
Back to the days when you were mine
Back to this faulty relationship
Back to the days when we both fit
(x2)

Is it this or could we still compliment
each other like colors in harmony that make
each other look brighter like we did in the old days---Lyrics submitted by Dani.
