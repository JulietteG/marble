Young Love Is Waiting.
Oh Young Love is waiting waiting
Underneath the moonlight
Oh in the sky so bright
If you would only find her
She'll be in your arms tonight, tonight, tonight 
Young love is something that money can't buy
And here's a little secret
You can find it if you try
It's high on a mountain or way out at sea
Wherever you are 
Young love will be 
I used to be alone
No one to call my own
I searched for my love everyday
And then I met her there
Someone who really cared
At last young love had come my way
Young love is something 
that money can't buy
And here's a little secret
 you can find it if you try
It's high on a mountain or way out at sea
Wherever you are
Young love will be
Wo Wo
Young Love
Wo Wo Wo 
Young love
Wo Wo Wo---Lyrics submitted by ErD.
