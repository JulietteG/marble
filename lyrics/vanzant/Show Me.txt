I've been burned 
I've been hurt
I've been kicked to the curb
Cause there's more than a little heart on this boy

If that look is for me
then I like what I see
Say you ain't just a dangerous toy
Got a bad attitude on this blue avenue
I need someone to convince me I'm wrong

I've been up 
I've been down 
I've been lost
I've been found
If you think you can turn this heart around

Show me 
Show me 
Take me in your arms and hold me
You got to 
Show me 
Show me
Show me a little rock and roll fire

If you won't, I can talk
Then you talk quite a walk
But I still can't qhite hear what you say
Come a little closer to me
Cause I want to believe
This don't happen to me everyday  yeah

Well it's 3 a.m. and I been waitin all night
For someone to light my soul
You been sayin it's you and I'm prayin it true
If this is love, girl, you know what to do 

Show me 
Show me
Take me in your arms and hold me
You got to 
Show me
Show me
Show me a little rock and roll fire

Come on and 
Show me
Show me
Baby turn around and hold me
You got to 
Show me
Show me
Show me a little rock and roll fire

Come on and show me

oh, oh
yeah, ha
(whispered) show me

If you won't, I can talk
Then you talk quite a walk
If you mean what you say, girl
We'll go all the way
If we like how it feels
Then we'll know that it's real

You've been saying it you
And I'm prayin it's true
If this is love, girl
You know what to do
Know what to do

Baby stop talkin and 
Show me 
Show me
Take me in your arms and hold me
You got to
Show me
Show me
Show me a little rock and roll fire

Come on and 
Show me
Show me
Baby turn around and hold me
You got to 
Show me
Show me
Show me a little rock and roll fire

Show me a little rock and roll fire

oh

Show me a little rock and roll fire

Girl, you got to show me---Lyrics submitted by Alicia.
