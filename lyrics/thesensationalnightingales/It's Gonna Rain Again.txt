Chorus:
Lord it's gonna rain
It's gonna rain
You betta get ready and bear this in mind
God shole know the rainbow sign
It won't be water but fire next time

Verse 1:
Way back when, the bible days
Noah told the people it's gonna rain
But when he told 'em they paid him no mind
And when it happened they was left behind

Chorus

Verse 2:
They tell me when the water begin to pour
They knocked on the window they knocked on the door
They didn't know exactly what to do
Now you don't want this to happen to you

Chorus

Noah said I'm sorry my friend
God got the key you can't get in
If something don't happen to the hearts of man
The same thing gonna happen again
