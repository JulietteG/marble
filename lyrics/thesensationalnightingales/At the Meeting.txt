I want to be at the meeting
I want to be at the meeting
I want to be at the meeting
When all the saints get home
After the separating of the right and the wrong
I want to be at the meeting around the throne

After the separating of the right and the wrong
I want to in the number when the saints go marching home
Trouble will be over, sorrow will be gone
Then I want to be at the meeting around the throne

When I get to Jordan, walk Jordan like a man
Unbuckle my sword off my side, stick it in the golden sand
Talk to God the Father, I'll talk to God the Son
Then we can have a meeting around the throne

When I get to Heaven, I'll meet my mother there, she'll say
God Almighty, here comes my child, he musta got here by prayer
We'll be at home, we'll sing a brand new song
Then we can shout "trouble's over" around the throne

I want to be at the meeting
I want to be at the meeting
I want to be at the meeting
When all the saints get home
After the separating of the right and the wrong
I want to be at the meeting around the throne.---Lyrics submitted by Michael Wombles.
