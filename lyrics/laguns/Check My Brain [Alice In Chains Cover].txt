So I found myself in the sun, oh yeah 
A hell of a place to end a run, oh yeah 
California, I'm fine 
Somebody check my brain 
California's all right 
Somebody check my brain 
Check my brain 

I walk these streets, I creep and I fall, oh yeah 
When she sang I answered the call, oh yeah 
California, I'm fine somebody check my brain 
California's all right somebody check my brain 
Aaaaah tears have filled my bones 
Aaaaah years expended gone 



I hung my guns and put em away, oh yeah 
The trick of the trade, and by the way, oh yeah 
California, I'm fine somebody check my brain 
California's all right somebody check my brain 

Aaaah tears have filled my bones 
aaaah years expended gone 


Check my brain, check my brain ...---Lyrics submitted by Anne.
