Hook (x2)

[B-Cide] Look at me now, still mashin n flashin
Stay party crashin, still get it crackin
[Shysty] Look at me now, gotta get the club jumpin
Girls shakin ass and the speakers keep bumpin

Shysty

When nysus raps in the mic, its like burnin crack in a pipe
Hold ya bitches close (Why?) cuz Im snaggin ya wife
Its gonna happen tonight, and Im gonna be tappin it twice
So take a chance on the mic and Im gonna flatten ya life
Look at the girls on the dance floor in them tight mini-skirts
Im not your ordinary cracker, Im not a white skinny twerp
I bet I get mo girls tonight than you get ass in a week
I make em gasp when I speak, when they see me
Cuz Im slappin that cheeks
Im like Morrison reborn into a rappin machine
For a cracker I mean, on the mic cuz Im after that green
Stackin it clean, Im underground so I got my back to the scene
Actually you need a sack and pair of balls to be king
Of this area, well bury ya six feet deep
But Id rather be in the club where the chicks need me
Cuz Im that acid takin, ex poppin, bowl rippin, coke sniffin
Some of the time, not all of the time
Right now I got ya hoes strippin

Hook (x2)

B-Cide

When me and Shysty rhyme its kinda like bangin a freak
But we stand the test of time and shell be gone in a week
Do you hear when I speak, or you critique my physique?
Ive been bangin hot bitches and they all want me
Cant get enough of this dick, she wanted all of it
Now shes goin through withdrawals like a fiend thats sick
It is so damn thick, and ya pussy was tight
I was all up in ya debun like every single night
Im in that B-Cide stance, makin everybody stomp
Got the whole place lookin at me, like it or not
If we droppin the top, will you drive it and stop
Make them wheels spin, glisten like Im shinin a glock
I gotta be me, bangin out to my own CD
Im like a fucked up kid on the LSD
Im makin money like a bank, aint holdin no hostages
And even my condoms come in gold foil packages
