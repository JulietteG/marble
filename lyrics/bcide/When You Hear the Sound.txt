Hook (x2)
When you hear the sound
All the bodies hit the ground
By the pound across town
When you hear the sound

When you hear the sound, I wanna see yall getting down
Like a shotgun got cocked and its sprayin some rounds
Move yo body side to side like you doin a thizz dance
Keep it movin, make it quick or youll catch one in the ass
Homeless people, business men, dont matter who you are
When you hear the sound, you better duck behind a car
Anythin to protect you from a ricochet
Stray bullets aint aimed at you, but still put you away
(Stray bullets aint aimed at you, but still put you away?)
What a frightening thing to say, it could ruin your day
It dont matter if ya black, white, brown, straight or gay
Try to run away past the bodies in the street
Dodgin high, duckin low to the sickle-swingin beat
Move quick, think fast cause it will be yo last
Close yo eyes, say goodbye, think a your past
Hear the bullets whizzing by, then its a flash

Hook (x2)

Bodies by the pound like you weighin slabs of meat
Tryna dodge these bullets as they fly by me
I see people run fa cover under obscure things
An old lady with a walker (BOOM) splattered her brains
Its like a free-for-all, remember SMASHtv?
But its live, in living color, right here on the streets
You could call the news people and they showin up fast
But they aint fast as the gun-blast that shoots they ass
Its B-Cide reporting live from Channel 2 news
But the news crews jetted, so I did too
So Im back on the move, and I got nothin to lose
Except my shoes, but I lost those back at the zoo
Watch out, look down, more bodies by the pound
And Im doin hurdles over them, look at me now!
And Im on the run, like an escaped fugitive
But Im in my street clothes and I aint doin a bid HUH

Hook (x2)

I found my way in the sewer system and they did too
I came out nasty and funky, smellin like rotten food
And as they chased me, they still poppin off rounds
Everybody in the vicinity keeps goin down
Lawyers, hookers, the occasional doctor
And that real annoying lady and you glad that they popped her
Find shelter, dont tell her that I told you so
Cuz if she finds out that Im right, then shell never go
Save yourself wit these people wit knowledge
But as I turned back I noticed they just shot up the college
And now they headed this way, imma make em chase me
Down the block, round the corner where they never will see
They quickly approachin, so I steal a new car
Right off the lot, no miles, but it dont start
Now Im fucked, there aint nowhere to turn
So they put the pistol to my head, cock back and let it burn---Lyrics submitted by Ronnie.
