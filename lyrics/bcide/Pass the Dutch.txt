Pass The Dutch

B-Cide

I dont understand how these people been lately
Cuz lately, every single one of yall hate me
Everything that I do, everywhere that I go
Somebodys gotta jock me and it all gets old
Everybodys rappin, thanks to actin
Puttin out movies, what you think would happen?
Givin people hope, thinkin they dope
Youd have a better future if you cookin up coke
Look (look) I dont mean to be mean
But theres too many fakers in this here rap scene
All you need is a dope beat and a catchy hook
And you got yourself a hit, WHOA, everybodys shook
If it took no time and a lil bit of effort
Then you better just stop, oh yeah I said it
I really need something to ease my mind
So Jaz get the chronic and press rewind

Hook (x2)

Pass the Dutch
Ashes to dust
Aint nobody ever gon fuck wit us
We got a few things that we keep on the low
Like I been hush-hush, never say it to folks and I say

The Homie Jaz

Here we go again, another toilet bowl rapper
Runnin round talkin bout that hes totin clappers
Tellin everybody you was locked in jail
Nigga be actin just like Denzel
Knowin damn well you couldnt slice a grape
Even if you stepped on it wit some Ginsu ice-skates
Tellin me that your CD is comin
But that was way back in nineteen-ninety somethin
And I still aint heard yo CD yet
But you still got that fake gold chain around yo neck
Oh, you thought I would keep it on the low
Bout the fake grill you bought out the Oriental liquor sto
No, Talkin bout you ridin in a Lexo
But every time you pull up, you in a Ford Bronco
This mothafuckas doin way too much
Man fuck this nigga, Yo B, pass the dutch

Hook (x2)


Shysty

No offense to every rapper in the area
But rappers need to understand that we just broke the barrier
Cuz I dont see you doin interviews in magazines
To prove to you were on the scene
With lack of sleep, Im practicing I
Hustle and flow those bundles of snow my
Budget is broke, so I fuck up your nose if you
Get in the way cuz tomorrows today
Back in the day you could say I was baggin that yayo
My pockets been empty, I happen to stay broke
We underground so you know that we stay low
Dont try to start up shit, just make the drama logical
Ya try to knock me out the game, youre not, it is impossible
A lotta rappers actin optimistic, treat me like a politician
Gotta lock you in the trunk to make you stop and listen
Im real like coke, you fake like bakin soda
Ya rhymes a joke, get ready were takin over---Lyrics submitted by Ronnie.
