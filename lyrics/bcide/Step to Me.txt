Look baby girl, we done took that path
Sometimes good, sometimes bad
I like to think it was good what we had
But now its just all bad (bad)

Step to me, come close
Lets ride, you and me both
Well fly, a new day
Make a right from the wrong that we made

B-Cide

All good things must come to an end
But the end of a friend like you aint the plan
Im miles away, but you seem so close
Backed up off when I needed you most
Treated like gold, a precious stone
Now Im just left here broke alone
Out of sight, out of mind
Need some time
Give it a little bit, and you will find
The man who loved you, treated you right
Would do it over time for the rest of your life
I cant make you understand
Ive said my piece
My words are power, my strength is weak
Youre the ink to my pen, the words to my pad
Look what we had, now its all bad
You got a hold on me, cant forget
Close my eyes and think of this

Check it pretty lady you been down here for a quick minute
And every time I wanna talk about it you aint in it
And every time I spend it like we gotta future in it
You talkin like it aint your business and you wanna finish
Dont front, dont lie, dont fight the feelin
I know that look in your eye when you ready willin
You say it aint right need some time to stop the spendin
But tell me whats right when your eyes continue spillin
I think about the good times forget about the bad
Just you and me layin with my body to your back
No stress, no problems, no pain
I promise the mistakes I made wont be the same
I give you shelter when it pours, when it rains
I keep you warm when the temperature change
Im standin right behind you with my lips to your neck
Im here baby girl Its on you whats next

Hook

Would it be alright if I called you up?
Late one night just to talk
I miss the conversation so amazin
Even dead air had me complacent
I wanna hear your voice say my baby
Those words haunt me, drive me crazy
My mind plays tricks, I think Im alright
And in the same damn thought, nothin is fine
I try to forget but my brain is sick
No doctor could cure this illness
The time it passes, cant outlast this
I feel burnt out, turned to ashes
The fire that burns, fueled with passion
Is slowly fading, no more action
I did all I could lord give me a sign
Let me know the future in time will be fine
