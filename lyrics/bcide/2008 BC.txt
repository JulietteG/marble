You wanna know what its like to be me now
Ive been grindin and hustlin up in the U Town
People think they know me, but aint down
Callin me a fake a phony like I should stop now

Im a take ya back to 83
Before you ever knew the C-I-D-E or knew me
Before my dad left, before we moved to my Nonnas
Before my brother was born and then my family was goners
Im a let you in, a bit of family history
My grandparents came over getting called WOPs and guineas
They call us daygos, cause they always just hate those
People lookin different than the ones in plain clothes
Immigrants in this they found themselves on Ellis island
To start a new life and you could see it inside em
Just like everyone does when they come to America
But you see the American dream is all that they sellin ya
Make the best of it and I know that they did
Because Im really proud to know of my Italian heritage
And rappers capitalize on the mafia trend
But if you knew the mafia men youd never rap again

Were a product of the 80s drivin my mother crazy
Me and my brother Nicholas Alexander, baby!
I hadda dream when I was young to be a frontman in the limelight
Always performnin at family functions, the times right
I didnt care of I was good or I sucked
Because the thing that really matters is that I would grow up
But then in high school, where fat kids are not scool
I met a bunch of dudes and I joined they group
I guess the tru inspiration is all these bands that Im playin
I love it all but Green Days always been in heavy rotation
Im bumpin, Kid Rock, ICP, Twiztid, and Blaze
Tech N9ne, C-Murder, Master P, No Limit for days
I got the ground work, then I started talkin to people
Im gonna make this thing happen or Ill die tryin well
Be the first to break out, Im lovin it no doubt
And its time something happened cuz its been 10 years now

I do this for a greater power, not just myself
Look at the underlying message of the song that you felt
I speak of free speech, while you other rappers on these streets
I love America the beautiful in poverty
You say I cant make a change because I swear to much
But I gotta be explicit now to get my point across
If you dont understand, then this just isnt for you
You shoulda never bought the CD in the first place dude
This is every emotion, this is all of my thoughts
This is how magic happens and I will show you it all
From the pen to the pad, from the pad to your head
From your head to the microphone and something is said
It aint gotta be much like what just ruined your day
You could put it in a rhyme and everythingll be great
I hate the fact that people tell you what you can and cant do
But they hate you even more when you speakin the truth
