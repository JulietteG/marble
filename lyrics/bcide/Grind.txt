Hook
We on the grind now, and Im tryin to get it
We gotta stack the paper high so the stations will spin it
And its a rat race, while Im tryin to save face
These people dont know that this business isnt a safe place

B-Cide

The struggle, the hustle, you call it what you will
But theres snipers in this business that are bred to kill
I dont care about yo battle rap, move to the back
Lets see you get in the studio, put yo skills on some wax
Does the microphone scare you? Producers are there too
And not the guy that makes ya beats, he is a lame fool
I see you people talkin like yo shits the shit
And all I ever hear is talkin cuz you never did shit
Less talk, more action, but youre too busy rappin
Ive been on my grind, doin me, makin it happen
Uticas just a fraction, a little distraction
A city of envious, they never backin
They own kind, hey guy, you not my buddy friend
Its a vicious circle in this place that we livin in
Talk behind your back like youll never find out
Then theyre cool to your face, its time to take em all out

Hook

Id get out if I could, but Im just too far in
And all the haters in my city pray Ill never rap again
Ive been doin me, I aint a thug Im a G
Im the B to the dash, ash C-I-D-E
And if ya lookin for me, Ill be right on genesee
Cuz there aint no other place Id rather be than U-T
I called up the bay, cuz they lovin my swagga
We gotta get it now and they showin love, bastard
From the valley to the valley, its New York and Cali
And the slangs a lil different but they still understand me
I got my boy First Class and hes ready to shoot
But wed rather make some loot off the verse we do
Fuck backpack rap, Ill cut your arms off ya shoulders
And watch yo backpack fall down to the floor
Im not tryin to diss, Im just sick of all this
And these faggot mothafuckas think they gonna get a hit

Hook

FIRST CLASS

Ya boy, he done done it again
So now they lookin round like somebody done dumpin that M
If you see him on the strip now, he aint stuntin for them
His swagga hopped out a DeLorean and jumped into him
Uh oh, they frontin again like packs on consignme
Which is why Im stuck with the heckla and somethin behind me
Figured hed be in the Hill so Ill pump out a tommy
Then line em up for free, down to his skin like Ghandi
Im who they thinkin of when they writin they rhymes
And they get they will power all from pipin them lines
License to grind, first get you a license to drive
You couldnt see me if the light wasnt all in his eyes
Whats wrong with this guy? he foreigned his mind with that Kush
Gym stars will turn his face into a wet-ass puss
I was on the edge, just chillin till I felt me a push
So now dem balls gone go through dis niggas basket like SWOOSH
