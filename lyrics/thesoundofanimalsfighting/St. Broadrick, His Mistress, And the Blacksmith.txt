i know you don't want change
but nothing is ever what it used to be
i know you don't want to change
grab the rope
i know you don't want change
but nothing is ever what it used to be
grab the rope 
hoist yourself up 
grab the rope 
grab the rope

lions of substance
a solutive parade
lions of substance
grab the rope


oh how i search through these memories
these three devils used to be apologies
i search through these memories
these three devils used to be apologies
i search through these memories
these three devils used to be apologies
memories
apologies
memories
apologies

i know you don't want change
i know you don't want change
hoist yourself up
lions of substance
lions of substance
a solutive parade
grab the rope
grab the rope
a solutive parade

silence creating bold letters like not and better
these three devils used to be apologies
is such a painful thing to see when the shadows didn't bend
these three devils used to be apostrophes
so i destroyed a monument, so what


i know you don't want change
but nothing is ever what it used to be
i know you don't want change
grab the rope---Lyrics submitted by alleyster.
