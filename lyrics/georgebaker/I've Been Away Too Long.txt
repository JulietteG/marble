How can I say to you. I love somebody new.
You were so good to me always.
And when I see your eyes. I can't go on with lie.
It breaks your heart, but I just can't hide it.

Oh, no...

I I've been away too long. Now I just can't go on.
I've been away too long. I, I've been away too long.
No, I can't be so strong. I've been away too long.
Don't look that way to me. It hurts you, so I see.

But I just can't go on with lie.
I gave you all I had. So there is nothing left.
I may be wrong, but I better go now.

Oh, no...
I, I've been away too long. Now I just can't go on.
I've been away too... I, I've been away too long.
No, I can't be so strong. I've been away too...

La, La, La, La, La, La, La.
La, La, La, La, La, La.

I've been away too long. ---Lyrics submitted by suman tedja.
