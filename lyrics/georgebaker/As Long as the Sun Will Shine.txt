Loneliness, feelings of pain in your heart
Youre not alone any more, give me your hand
Anything I do if you give me your love
You make my dreams come true, please understand

As long the sun will shine my love, my love will leave you never
As long the sun will shine my love, this dream will be forever
But stars are cloudily and gray
Nothing can take us away
As long the sun will shine my love, my love is in your heart
As long the sun will shine my love, my love is in your heart

You and I are born for a wonderful live
Say that you will be mine, and Ill be your man
Your the day and Ill be your night time, my love
Nothing can be more than this, if only you say

As long the sun will shine my love, my love will leave you never
As long the sun will shine my love, this dream will be forever
But stars are cloudily and gray
Nothing can take us away
As long the sun will shine my love, my love is in your heart
As long the sun will shine my love, my love is in your heart---Lyrics submitted by zane cuxton.
