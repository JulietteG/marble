Be my lady 
Come to me and take my hand 
And Be my lady 
Surely you must know by now
That I'm in love with you 
And all I want is you 
How I need you 
So please... 

Be my lady 
I know you'd lose the pain 
If you just trust in me 
Say the words you long to whisper 
That I want to hear 
Somethings on your mind 
Is it hidden in your smile 

Be My Lady 
Please forget the past 
It's time to mend your broken heart 
Let no walls divide us now 
Dry those tears in your eyes 
There's nothing more to fear
I'll give you all I have 

Be My Lady 
You're the one that I adore 
Please believe me 
I could never find the courage 
To resist your charm 
Nothing's more divine 
Than each moment 
You are arms

Be My Lady 
Please forget the past 
It's time to mend your broken heart 
Let no walls divide us now 
Dry those tears in your eyes 
There's nothing more to fear
I'll give you all I have 

Be My Lady 
Let the sun shine in your heart 
Let's make a brand new start 
Stay with me each night and day 
For the rest of my life 
Just like a work of art 
My love will last forever 

Just like a work of art 
My love will last 
Be My Lady.---Lyrics submitted by Charles Escusa.
