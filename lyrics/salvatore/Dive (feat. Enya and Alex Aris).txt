Baby there's shark in the water
But I need to get in
I need to cross the border
I need it oh oh
You know we ain't getting younger
We'll sink or we'll swim
Baby are you with me?
Oh oh

I've been doing it myself
But now I need some help
Ain't nobody, no me better, than you know me
I don't wanna drown
I don't wanna drown tonight

So tell me would dive with me?

Darling there's a storm a coming
I Feel the winds blowing
I'm heading for the horizon
I need it oh oh
All around the waves are getting steeper
But I know, we can swim
So baby are You with me?
Oh oh

I've been doing it myself
But now I need some help
Ain't nobody, no me better, than you know me
I don't wanna drown
I don't wanna drown tonight

So tell me would dive with me?

Standing by the rocks
Feel the ocean crash
Don't push me
Cause I'm close to the edge---
