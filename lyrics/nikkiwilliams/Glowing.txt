This is my confessional
Seven seconds till I hit the ground
But you saved my life!
Now I feel indestructible
So protected when you're around
Yeah, you saved my life!

Bridge:
You make me, you make me feel so incredible
You and I, you and I feels so unbelievable
You're making, you're making so unenviable

Chorus:
A million hearts, but you're the only one
You locked me up like I'm glowing in the dark!
I'm in your heart, you're the only one
You locked me up like I'm glowing in the dark!

This is my confessional
Seven seconds till I hit the ground
But you saved my life!
Now I feel indestructible
So protected when you're around
Yeah, you saved my life!

Bridge:
You make me, you make me feel so incredible
You and I, you and I feels so unbelievable
You're making, you're making so unenviable

Chorus:
A million hearts, but you're the only one
You locked me up like I'm glowing in the dark!
I'm in your heart, you're the only one
You locked me up like I'm glowing in the dark!

This is my confessional
Seven seconds till I hit the ground
But you saved my life!
Now I feel indestructible
So protected when you're around
Yeah, you saved my life!

Chorus: (x2)
A million hearts, but you're the only one
You locked me up like I'm glowing in the dark!
I'm in your heart, you're the only one
You locked me up like I'm glowing in the dark!---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
