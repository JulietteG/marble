If youre gone before I wake up
Just promise that youll be okay, love
Too many times you left me better
We need to share this one together

So, I will wait for you
This love was made for two
And Ill hold on this time
No, I wont leave you behind
I will wait for you.

I promise darling that I wont sleep
Until we reached the highest mountain peek
Thanks for the times that you were there for me
So let me payback all your charity

So, I will wait for you
This love was made for two
And Ill hold on this time
No, I wont leave you behind

Girl, Ive been so cruel
I broke the golden rule
So shame on me for leaving you this way
Ive turned this once before
Ive left you wanting more
And we both know the fools rushing

I will wait for you
I will wait for you
And Ill hold on this time
And I wont leave you behind
I will wait for you
I will wait for you
Wait for you, I will wait for you.---
