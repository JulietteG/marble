Freedom by The Katinas

Verse 1:  .......????.................this sense of liberty
             I think its safe to say its taken over me
             For this we fought so long it wasn't all for nothing
             Trails & tribulations they come to make us strong

B Verse:  Now more than ever we stand
             We locked together within
             We've been united by faith
             Not gonna run away now
             So with the spirit of hope
             We'll find our victory
             It lies inside of our souls
             Just believe

Chorus:  Raise your hands to the sky
             If you feel what I'm feeling
             To the end we will fight
             We will fight for our freedom

Verse 2:  Now let the darkness fall shadows are closing in
             The air is getting cold depression settle in
             Don't wait until its over time will not delay
             So stop procrastinating time to break the chain

B Verse: Let's come together ......?
            The world is watching
            Our faith is even stronger now
            Despite all the opposition
            So with the spirit of hope
            We'll find our victory
            It lies inside of our souls
            Just believe
