I.
Lord im really glad you're here
I hope You feel the same when you see all my fear
and how i fail
I fall sometimes

Its hard to walk on shifting sand
I missed the rock and find there's no where left to stand
i start to cry Lord please help me

Bridge
Raise my hands so you can lift me up
hold me close
hold me tighter

Chorus
I have found a place where i can hide
its safe inside your arms of love
I could shout His help throughout the storm
you keep me warm in your arms of love
...arms of love

II.
storms will come and storms will go
i wonder just how many storms it takes until i finally know
you're here always 

Bridge
even when my skies'll fall so grey
i can stay teach me
to stay there

Chorus
Every place I've found where i can hide
its safe inside your arms of love
I could shout His help throughout the storm
you keep me warm in your arms of love
...arms of love
