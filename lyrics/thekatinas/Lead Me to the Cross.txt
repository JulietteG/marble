When I wake in the morn'in
First thing I've gotta do
Is get myself right 
Devoted totally to you

Crucial moment
Can't let it pass me by
I've got to get right through
To reach the other side

Dark and dangerous world
Awaits one everyday
Before I walk out the door
This is what I say...

(Chorus)
Lord you lead me
I promise I will follow
Leave the past behind
Take no sorrow
Anywhere you want me
Whatever I will do for you
You just that the word
And I'll be there

Even in the night
When I lay my head to sleep
Don't take your sprit from me
Here's my soul to keep

Please speak to me
Things I've never dreamed
Lord, just one word is all I need
I can change the world
With You by my side
Don't have a thing to fear
Will You be my guide

(Chorus)

I'll follow you
When you open up the door
Tell me it's okay
I'll go through
I'll follow you
You just tell me where to go
I'll be on my way trusting You

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
