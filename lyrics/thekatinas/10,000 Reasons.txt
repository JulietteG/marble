Verse I
The sun comes up, its a new day dawning
Its time to sing Your song again
Whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me
Let me be singing when the evening comes

Chorus
Bless the Lord, Oh my soul
Oh my soul
Worship His holy name
Sing like never before
Oh my soul
Ill worship Your holy name

Youre rich in love and Youre slow to anger
Your name is great and Your heart is kind
For all Your goodness I will keep on singing
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find

Chorus
Bless the Lord, Oh my soul
Oh my soul
Worship His holy name
Sing like never before
Oh my soul
Ill worship Your holy name

Refrain
Bless the Lord
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find
Bless the Lord
Ten thousand years and then forevermore

Verse III
And on that day when my strength is failing
The end draws near and my time has come
Still my soul will sing Your praise unending
Ten thousand years and then forevermore

Chorus
Bless the Lord, Oh my soul
Oh my soul
Worship His holy name
Sing like never before
Oh my soul
Ill worship Your holy name

Bless the Lord
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find
Bless the Lord
Ten thousand years and then forevermore
