I
Im listening to a new song from heaven
Im wide awake, yet dreaming of You
Though Im not alone
Im desperate without You
I see You mercy
Lord You are holy
I want to be more like You

Chorus:
Teach me to live Your love
Help me to give Your love
Show me Your way
Lord Ill obey
Your word and live Your love

II
I stand in awe, grateful remembrance
Press towards the goal
For the price I must win
Ive got my eyes
Focused upon You
Show me your beauty
Cause Lord its your goodness
That makes me more like You

Repeat: Chorus

Bridge:
Holy wind, blow fresh
Your fire anew
Come breathe on my soul
Let my heart be for You
Ive witnessed the light
And the power of Your might

Repeat: Chorus---Lyrics submitted by Anthony.
