i will meet you in the city
when it little upon the stars
and the moon are all pretty
cause the paint of the sky
and i fell like you belong
to story we heard
doesn't matter if it's your song
and you dont know all the words

we should put up a sign
we are citizen of all you can see
we've got nothing but time

you'll find
everything you didn't do
everything you didn't do
standing right in front of you
aaa...aaaa....
aaa...aaaa.... uooo...
aaa...aaaa....
aaa...aaaa.... uooo...

we should put up a sign
we are citizen of all you can see
we've got nothing but time

you'll find
everything you didn't do
everything you didn't do
standing right in front of you
aaa...aaaa....
aaa...aaaa.... uooo...
aaa...aaaa....
aaa...aaaa.... uooo...

i don't even know what to say about every little thing
cause i'm tired and i want to go to sleep

it's so clear now
it's so clear now
it's so clear now
it's so clear now
it's so clear now
it's so clear now

you'll find
everything you didn't do....
everything you didn't do...
everything you didn't do...

(Frank T)

standing right in front of you
aaa...aaaa....
aaa...aaaa.... uooo...
aaa...aaaa....
aaa...aaaa.... uooo...
