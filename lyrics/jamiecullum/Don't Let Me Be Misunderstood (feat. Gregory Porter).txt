Baby, do you understand me now
Sometimes you see that I'm mad
But don't you know that no one
Can always be an angel
When everything goes wrong you see some bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Understand me, understand me

Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes it seems again that all I have is worry
Then you're bound to see my other side
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy I want you to know (Want you to know)
That I never meant to take it out on you
Life has it's problems and I've got my share
And that's one thing I never meant to do (Oh)
Now baby, I'm only human
And I've got fault like anyone
Sometimes I find myself alone regretting
Some little foolish thing some simple thing I've done
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood (Oh)
Understand me, understand me, understand me
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood---
