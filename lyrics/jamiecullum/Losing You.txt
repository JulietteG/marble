Was a fool with my money
And I lost every dime
Sun stopped shining
And it rained all the time
Did set me back some
But I made it through
But I'll never get over losing you

Do you know how much you mean to me?
Should've told you but it's true
I'd get over losing anything
But I'll never get over losing you

When you're young
And there's time
To forget the past
You don't think that you will
But you do
And I know that I don't have time enough
But I'll never get over losing you

I've been cold
I've been hungry
But not for a while
Most of my dreams have come true
With it all here around me
No peace do I find
'Cause I'll never get over losing you
No, I'll never get over losing you---
