So tenderly your story is
Nothing more than what you see
Or what you've done or will become
Standing strong do you belong
In your skin; just wondering

Gentle now the tender breeze blows
Whispers through my gran torino
Whistling another tired song

Engine humms and bitter dreams grow
Heart locked in a gran torino
It beats a lonely rhythm all night long
It beats a lonely rhythm all night long
It beats a lonely rhythm all night long

[*sung by jamie cullum*]
Realign all the stars above my head
Warning signs travel far
I drink instead on my own oh! How i've known
The battle scars and worn out beds

Gentle now a tender breeze blows
Whispers through a gran torino
Whistling another tired song

Engines humm and bitter dreams grow
Heart locked in a gran torino
It beats a lonely rhythm all night long

These streets are old they shine
With the things i've known
And breaks through the trees
Their sparkling

Your world is nothing more than all the tiny things you've left behind

So tenderly your story is
Nothing more than what you see
Or what you've done or will become
Standing strong do you belong
In your skin; just wondering

Gentle now a tender breeze blows
Whispers through the gran torino
Whistling another tired song
Engines humm and bitter dreams grow
A heart locked in a gran torino
It beats a lonely rhythm all night long

May i be so bold and stay
I need someone to hold
That shudders my skin
Their sparkling

Your world is nothing more than all the tiny things you've left behind

So realign all the stars above my head
Warning signs travel far
I drink instead on my own oh how ive known
The battle scars and worn out beds

Gentle now a tender breeze blows
Whispers through the gran torino
Whistling another tired song
Engines humm and better dreams grow
Heart locked in a gran torino
It beats a lonely rhythm all night long
It beats a lonely rhythm all night long
It beats a lonely rhythm all night long---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
