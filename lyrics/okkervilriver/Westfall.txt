I'm surrounded, each doorway covered
by at least twenty men.
They're going to take me and throw me in prison.
I ain't coming back again.

When I was younger, handsomer and stronger,
I felt like I could do anything.
But all of these people making all these faces
Didn't seem like my kith and kin.
Didn't seem like my kith and kin.

Colin Kincaid from the twelfth grade,
I guess you could say he was my best friend.
He lived in a big tall house out on Westfall
where we would hide when the rain rolled in.

We went out one night and took a flashlight,
out with these two girls Colin knew from Kenwood Christian.
One was named Laurie, that's what the story
said next week in the Guardian.
Said next week in the Guardian.

And when I killed her it was so easy
that I wanted to kill her again.
I got down on both of my knees and...
She ain't coming back again.

Now, with all these cameras focused on my face,
you'd think they could see it through my skin.
They're looking for evil, thinking they can trace it,
but evil dont look like anything.---Lyrics submitted by Taylor.
