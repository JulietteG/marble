Tonight I lack the strength to even move, 
When you walked, now watch me die

For I know this is harder for you,
For love has let you down

The road ahead is lined with broken dreams,
So walk, walk on by

And I failed to give you everything you need,
For the fears, behind your eyes

When I cant feel you,
Im not alright, Im not alright,
When I cant heal you,
Im not alright, Im not alright

When I cant feel you,
Im not alright, Im not alright,
When I cant heal you,
Im not alright, Im not alright

Jesus as you throw me on the rocks,
For love I left your side

For I believed in love and beautys wiles, Where heaven shone from her eyes

Tell me that it wasnt all for naught,
Its such a waste now, Its such a waste now cmon
I know your scared but baby dont you hide,
Its such a waste,
Well stand alone now, well make it somehow---Lyrics submitted by Nitzia.
