It's later on a Wednesday, the sun is going down
I'm standing naked by a swimming pool, there's no one around
My imagination wanders back, red dust is always there
We lay together in the jungle, and love was in the air

As I dive into the water, both time and motion freeze
I'm hanging there suspended like a feather in the breeze
Below is your reflection, like an image from the past
But I can't be sure if it's really you, 'cause you're wearing a tribal
Mask

Take it off, take off the mask, take it off, take off the mask
Take it off, take off the mask, take it off, take off the mask

There is no way of knowing how long I must remain
Dangling like a statue, and whispering your name
But suddenly it's over, and I begin to fall
But the swimming pool is empty now, no water there at all

I find myself in a room, empty and it's bare
With nothing but a mirror, and I know you're waiting there
I'm looking for an answer, but I don't know who to ask
I see my own reflection, but this time, I got the mask

I can't take it, I can't take it
I can't take it, I can't take it

Ah I can't take it, no
I can't take it, no, no
I can't take it, I can't take it
I can't take it, no, no, no---Lyrics submitted by Kazuyuki.
