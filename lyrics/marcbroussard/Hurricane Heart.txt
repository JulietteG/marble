You tell me I'm unfaithful
If that's the way you feel
This is gonna be painful
'Cause it's about to get real

You're telling me to be honest
How I wish I could
'Cause all I ever wanted was
Just to be understood

I'm rolling stone with a loaded gun
?
Baby, I was born to run

I didn't mean to break your heart this reckless
Was a long shot love we had
To begin with

I wish it didn't go down like this
My hurricane heart
You're picking up the pieces

I'm tired of talking it over
I've said what I needed to say
You point your finger at the sinner
I never said I was a saint

Fell in love with the prodigal son
Rapid man, yes I am

I didn't mean to break your heart
Just reckless
Was a long shot love we had
To begin with

I wish it didn't go down like this
My hurricane heart
You're picking up the pieces

I wish it didn't go down like this

I didn't mean to break your heart
This reckless

Was a long shot love we had
To begin with

I wish it didn't go down like this
My hurricane heart
You're picking up the pieces---
