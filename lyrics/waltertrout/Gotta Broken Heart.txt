You got a broken heart, And you don't know why
You're feelin' so alone, All you do is cry
Everytime you think about it, you just don't understand
You used to have a lover, now you're such a lonely man
You got to get her back, you're running out of time
You're living on the edge, about to loose your mind
With your broken heart, With your broken heart

You're spendin' every day, sittin' home alone
You're longing for your baby, but your baby's gone
She didn't give a reason, for walking out the door
You're so damned tired of wandering, you just can't take no more
Your hopin' and praying, seemed to be in vain
And you'd give anything, just to get her back again
With your broken heart babe, You've got a broken heart
Got such a broken heart, lord you got a broken heart

You've got a broken heart, and that's all you know
You feel you're goin' under, because you miss her so
Got to get yourself together, no matter what it cost
When you're out in stormy weather, it's so easy to get lost
Got to get her back, whatever else to do
She's the only one, who just might pull you through
Your broken heart, through your broken heart
Through your broken heart, lord broken heart
Lord yeah, yeah, yeah ---Lyrics submitted by Lorry Hansen.
