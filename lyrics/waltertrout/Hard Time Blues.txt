Yeah
Youre telling me - nobody understands
Aint nobody - ever had that easy
And all your life - youve been running from the shadows
Youre telling everybody  Youve got the hard time blues

Youre spending time - looking for a reason
Trying to find - somebody you can duel
Every day - youre looking for fighting
To listen to you when you talk about your hard time blues
Whoooohoee! 

Walk on ahead - keep doing what youve done
And youd might find - the time paid dues
Look inside - and you might find the answer

And find you have enough - for the hard time blues
You might find you had enough - all the hard time blues
And then you havent had enough whoo! the hard time blues---Lyrics submitted by Tony Krijnen.
