Well you hide your face / When the teardrops start

'Cause they laugh at you / if you show your heart

They say hurtful words / But it just ain't true
'Cause behind the laughter / They feel just like you

So you can / cry if you want to / cry if you want to
cry if you want to / don't hold it all inside

well they'll never understand / they'll never know
Just how deep are the feelings / that move you so

But there ain't no shame / to show the way you feel
You're only flesh and blood / so you ain't made of steel

So you can / cry if you want to / cry if you want to
Cry if you want to / don't let 'em hurt your pride

So go ahead / and let the teardrops flow 
don't you turn away / don't let them hurt you so

And you can tell them all / that you know it's true
There's gonna come a day / when they'll be cryin' too

So you can / cry if you want to / cry if you want to
cry if you want to / don't hold it all inside 
Don't you let 'em hurt your pride / you can cry if you want to---Lyrics submitted by Cliff Owens.
