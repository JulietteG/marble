I got the blues for my baby...
and I wish that shed come back home
Got the blues for my baby...
and I wish that shed come back home
[It] seems like such a long time...
since my little girl,
since my little girls been gone...

I call my baby on the telephone,
and I tell her that I feel so bad
And she said Listen to me Walter,
Im sorry that you feel so sad
I got the blues for my baby...
and I wish that shed come back home

I feel so lonesome without her, ayeah-et...
since my little girls been gone, been gone...

Ima play a little bit now...
keep it in the alley fellas...

I call my baby last night,
and I asked her what was wrong
And I told her that I feel so bad,
wha-af, since she been gone
And I got the blues for my baby...
Lord I wish shed come back home

Cause I feel so bad, feel so bad...
since my girl, since she been gone...

Take it home fellas...---
