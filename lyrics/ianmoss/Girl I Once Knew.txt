I got faith in destiny, And I know it won't set me free 
If I could go back in time 
Id make it right, I know I'd make you mine.

So whatever happened, to the girl I once knew? We had a love, it was a good thing it's true.

I dream one day we'll meet again
Coz I know we are like old friends
And I got faith in destiny and I know it won't set me free, it won't set me free

So whatever happened to the girl I once knew? We had a love, it was a good thing it's true 
Now every thought of her, makes me so blue, whatever happened to the girl I once knew?

She was one of a kind
I can't get her off of my mind
We had it all and let it slip away.
Don't care how long it takes 
I just gotta "mella" mistakes and I know, oh yes I know

I got faith in destiny
And I know it won't set me free
If I could go back in time
I'd make it right, I know I'd make her mine
I know id make her mine

So whatever happened to the girl I once knew? We had a love, it was a good thing it's true
Now every thought of her, makes me so blue, whatever happened to the girl I once knew?

So whatever happened to the girl I once knew? We had a love, it was a good thing it's true
Now every thought of her, makes me so blue, whatever happened to the girl I once knew?---Lyrics submitted by Dylan J Seegers.
