Goodbye to the future
Goodbye I used to know you
(x7)
Goodbye to the future

I found myself in the strangest place I've ever known
While in my mind I try and find a way back to you
(back, back, back to you)(x2)
They built a whole new time and space but I'll never go
No when it's over I'll be running home back to you
(back, back, back to you)(x2)

Coz all the love I need
All your hopes, your touch, defeated
Time and again
Oh like a dreamer you taught me to let go

[Chorus]
Goodbye to the future
Goodbye I used to know you
Goodbye to the future
Goodbye I used to know you
Coz I can't predict the future
I can forget (threw it away)
Goodbye to the future
Goodbye I used to know you
(x2)

I fought a war with my counterfeit
I fought it alone
And every moment brought a feeling of fear to me
(fear, fear, fear to me)
Near to me
A million blows couldn't conquer it
So I took it along
And now these moments are becoming so dear to me
(dear, dear, dear to me)
Real to me

A cut, a foil, to spite my face
Too far to crawl
You pick me up and again
Love like a savior
You help me to let go

[Breakdown + Chorus]
Goodbye to the future
Goodbye I used to know you
Goodbye to the future
Goodbye I used to know you
Coz I can't predict the future
I can forget (threw it away)
Goodbye to the future
Goodbye I used to know you
(x3)---
