It goes like the clouds
It floats like the Sky
I want to go someplace 
and find you there.

Don't go away
I need you to stay
I want to go someplace
and find you there

And yes you just run to him
And i'll be down on my knees
begging you 
Begging you don't 
I love you

I saw through your lies
I saw through your disguise
I want to go someplace 
and find you there

And yes you just run to him
And i'll be down on my knees
begging you 
Begging you don't 
I love you

Don't go away
I need you to stay
I want to go someplace
and find you there---Lyrics submitted by Timmy Stuart Davis.
