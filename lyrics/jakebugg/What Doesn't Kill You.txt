Step out the door 2 AM yesterday
Me and my friend keeping the night aflame
And as were walking in the clear night blind
Two guys come up and take him out of sight
All I know is one thing they hit him hard he doubles up
They takes his money and they run and all I can do is watch them go
His hands are round his nose
His blood is on his clothes

What doesnt kill ya
What doesnt hurt
Sometimes you feel youre up against the world
What doesnt kill ya
What doesnt break
This life it seems
To bring you to your knees
You try you bleed then finally you breathe

She was the dream that kept me up at night
I couldnt face the world without her eyes
I never knew it till she disappeared
My life would be a bunch of souvenirs
All I know is what it is her heart she doubles up
She packs her bag and then she runs and all I can do is watch her go
Ive lost all I own

What doesnt kill ya
What doesnt hurt
Sometimes you feel youre up against the world
What doesnt kill ya
What doesnt break
This life it seems
To bring you to your knees
You try you bleed then finally you breathe

What doesnt kill ya
What doesnt hurt
Sometimes you feel youre up against the world
What doesnt kill ya

What doesnt break
This life it seems
To bring you to your knees
You try you bleed then finally you breathe---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
