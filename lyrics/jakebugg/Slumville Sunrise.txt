The wind is beating on my window. I haven't slept all night.
That drum just keeps on banging.
They must be buzzing in the mind, bees in the hive
Tell me when the morning arrives.
This place is just not for me I say it all the time.
My friends they just ignore me.
Tell me nevermind, waiting on your line for the Slumville Sunrise.
Slumville Sunrise.
Nobody cares or looks twice.
Shout away in the morning across this place where I was born in.
Every roof, every flower illuminated by the morning.

My face upon the concrete, the dirt is in my mouth.
I clench my fist and feet. I try to cry out loud.
Make a sound, somethin is keepin me down.
This place is just not for me
I'll say it a thousand times
My friends they just ignore me. Tell me nevermind
Waiting on your line for the Slumville Sunrise.
Slumville Sunrise
Nobody cares or looks twice.
Shout away in the morning across this place where I was born in.
Every roof, every flower illuminated by the morning.

(Guitar Solo)

This place is just not for me
I say it all the time
My friends they just ignore me. Tell me nevermind.
Waiting on your line for the Slumville Sunrise.
Slumville Sunrise.
Nobody cares or looks twice.
Shout away in the morning across this place where I was born in.
Every roof, every flower illuminated by the morning.
