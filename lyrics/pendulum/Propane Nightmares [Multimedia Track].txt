Somethings tearing me down
And down
Cant help but feel its coming from you
Shes a gunshot bride
With a trigger cries
I just wonder what weve gotten our selves into
In a trail of fire I know we will be free again
In the end we will be one
In a trail of fire Ill burn before you bury me
Set your sights for the sun

Mind is willing
Soul remains
This woman cannot be saved
From the drawn into the fire
Mind is willing
Soul remains
This woman cannot be saved
From the drawn into the fire
Any danger
Bring it on home (4x)

Much to weak to jump yourself
Heal the wounds or crack the shell
Lift yourself from once below
Much to weak to jump yourself
Heal the wounds or crack the shell
Lift yourself from once below
Praise the anger
Bring it on home (4x)

In a trail of fire I know we will be free again
In the end we will be one
In a trail of fire Ill burn before you bury me
Set your sights for the sun
Bring it on home---Lyrics submitted by lucas.
