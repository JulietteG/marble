change your visions, give us a sound
keep your ears to the ground..
Lost your mind, and out of control
(im gona be a fucking superstar)

change your visions give us a sound
keep your ears to the ground
lost your mind, and out of control..

Change your visions give us a sound
keep your ears to the ground
Lost your mind, and out of control
(im gona be a fucking superstar)

Its not too much to ask of you baby,
its not too much to ask..
its not too much to ask of you baby,
why dont you come around, come around, come around..

just leave this place,
so no-ones a flat age..
just leave this place
We are going to turn things around.

Change your visions give us a sound
keep your ear to the ground
Lost your mind, outta control..

Change your visions give us a sound 
keep your ear to the ground
Lost your mind outta control..
(im gona be a fucking superstar)

Well its not too much to ask of you baby,
not too much to ask..
well its not too much to ask of you baby,
why don't you come around come around, come around..

Just leave this place,
so no-ones a flat age
just leave this place
we're gona turn things around..

Change your visions give us a sound..
keep yours ears to the ground,
Lost your mind outta control..

Change your visions give us a sound,
Keep your ears to the ground,
Lost your mind, outta control
(Im gona be a fucking superstar..)---Lyrics submitted by Hattie.
