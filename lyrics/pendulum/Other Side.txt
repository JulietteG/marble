Come on down to the other side,
Come with us through the gates of hell,
Where we'll drag you from where you are
to where you belong.

Come on down to the other side,
Come with us through the gates of hell,
Where we'll drag you from where you are
to where you belong.

There's nothing to fear,
Your saviors are here,
The shift is coming down,
The shift is coming down,
The shift is coming down,
Coming down,
Coming down,

You, You look so precious,
A diamond in rough,
And you tried to escape,
But we're holding on,

But i can't sleep until this is done,
They're in my head
They're in my soul

Come on down to the other side,
Come with us through the gates of hell,
Where we'll drag you from where you are
to where you belong.

Come on down to the other side,
Come with us through the gates of hell,
Where we'll drag you from where you are
to where you belong.

We are in your spirit,
We're everywhere you turn,
From the cover undercover,
The cover undercover,
In your lover,
In your brother,
In your brother,
The other's,

You, You look so precious,
But now we're on are way,
And I am falling apart,
I'll get the waves,

But i can't sleep until this is done,
They're in my head
They're in my soul

Through the gates of hell,
We know you,

The shift is coming down,
The shift is coming down,
The shift is coming down,
The shift is coming down,
Coming down,
Coming down,
Coming down,
Coming down,
Coming down,
Coming down,
Coming down,
Coming down,

Down to the other side,
Come with us through the gates of hell,
Where we'll drag you from where you are
to where you belong.

Come on down to the other side,
Come with us through the gates of hell,
Where we'll drag you from where you are
to where you belong.---Lyrics submitted by Aleksandra.
