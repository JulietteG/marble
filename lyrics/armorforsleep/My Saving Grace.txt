Am I toy to you?
With strings around my fingers,
for you to pull and watch, as I collapsed when you want.
The coldest night to me, is a switch that you control.
Tip-toe around your words just to calm you down again.

There's too many people that we both love,
and too many secrets i don't wanna know.

You're still chasing him.
My saving grace is saving face.
Lost on the back burner.
Good for.. good for you.
My saving grace is saving face.
I just sit and wait.

There's always just enough of you to pull me back.
But I can see your eyes drifting past what you have.
I'm flagging down a ship when it's on its way to sea.
The horn is blaring out, but I just don't want to hear.

I never left you in a sandstorm.
I never left or a second at all.

You're still chasing him.
My saving grace is saving face.
Lost on the back burner.
Good for.. good for you.
My saving grace is saving face.
I just sit and wait.

I thought you were an angel, 
I guess you were a vulture.
Either way, spread your wings and just fly away..
{Repeat 2x}

You're still chasing him.
My saving grace is saving face.
Lost on the back burner.
Good for.. good for you.
My saving grace is saving face.
I just sit and wait.

I just sit and wait.
[Spread your wings and fly away]
