I have come from so far away
From the sunlight of my home
And I have seen it's the only way
Now my sun is dead and gone

I raise my head in silent anger
Seems there is no place for me
The only way out is to go
Where no one's gone before

Fly - Beyond the gates of space and time
Another universe is mine
And I can't wait until tomorrow
Ride - There's a call from deep within
No I won't return again
`Cause I will dive into the black hole

Don't wait for me, 'cause I won't come back
Oh don't wait for me, no I won't come back
Oh don't wait for me, no I won't come back
Oh, oh, oh ...

Thunder and lightning and fire
Are guiding the trip of my life
Insatiable burning desire
As into the unknown I dive

I raise my head in silent anger
Seems there is no place for me
The only way out is to go
Where no one's gone before

Fly - Beyond the gates of space and time
Another universe is mine
And I can't wait until tomorrow
Ride - There is a call from deep within
I know I won't return again
`Cause I will dive into the black hole

Don't wait for me, 'cause I won't come back
Oh don't wait for me, no I won't come back
Oh don't wait for me, no I won't come back
Oh, oh, oh, don't wait

There was a trigger, for my decision
It's right behind my eyes
Into the darkness of my vision
I let my spirit rise

I wanna see the black hole, into the dark
I wanna dive into the black hole, down into the dark
Into the black hole, into the dark
Into the spiral, Into the dark, the dark, the dark

If there's a possible chance for something that can be
Called future behind the spiral
The only way to find out, is to leave the final frontier
To eternity and fly

I will fly - Beyond the gates of space and time
I leave the universe behind
And I can't wait until tomorrow

Fly - Beyond the gates of space and time
I know the universe is mine
`Cause I will dive into the black hole

Ride - And there's a call from deep within
I know I won't return again
`Cause I will dive into the black hole

Don't wait for me, 'cause I won't come back
Oh don't wait for me, no I won't come back
Oh don't wait for me, no I won't come back
Oh, oh, oh, don't wait---Lyrics submitted by Giovane.
