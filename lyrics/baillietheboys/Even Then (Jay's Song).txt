Every time I watch the sun set
I confess I feel so small
Then I feel you there beside me
And Im not afraid at all

If my arms no longer held you
And my lips couldnt call your name
If the sun went down forever
My love would still remain

Refrain
Even when my heart stops beating
And Ive taken my last breath
Even that wont come between us
I will love you, even then

Every time I hear your laughter
It leaves a smile upon my face
Every moment shared together
Is a moment of grace.

When my eyes no longer see you,
Reaching out to touch my hand,
Dont think the love has ended,
Because I hope you understand.
Refrain (2 times)---
