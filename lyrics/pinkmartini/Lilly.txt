Lilly comes when you stop to call her 
Lilly runs when you look away 
Lilly leaves kisses on your collar 
Lilly, Lilly, Lilly, Lilly, stay! 

Lilly comes when you stop to call her 
Lilly runs when you look away 
Lilly leaves kisses on your collar 
Lilly, Lilly, Lilly, Lilly, stay! 

One day she passed him by 
A twinkle in her eye 
He said " she was meant for me!" 
But when he turned around 
He lost what he had found 
Oh where can his Lilly be?

Lilly comes when you stop to call her 
Lilly runs when you look away 
Lilly leaves kisses on your collar 
Lilly, Lilly, Lilly, Lilly, stay! 

He searched the city streets 
He tempted her with treats 
But nobody stopped to taste them 
Some are in his pocket 
Some are in a locket 
He couldn't bring himself to waste them

Ever since she's gone 
Some days he can't go on 
She runined for another 
Pressed up against the glass 
He prays that she will pass 
Now he's living with his mother

Lilly comes when you stop to call her 
Lilly runs when you look away 
Lilly leaves kisses on your collar 
Lilly, Lilly, Lilly, Lilly, stay!

Lilly comes when you stop to call her 
Lilly runs when you look away 
Lilly leaves kisses on your collar 
Lilly, Lilly, Lilly, Lilly, stay!

Stay, stay, stay, stay---Lyrics submitted by Ian.
