The Samovara is full of tea
You stare unblinkingly at me
While your car waits in the freezing rain
I know your soul calls Moscow home
But your heart belongs to Rome
So for years, I've followed you in vain

But all, will you ever know what you are?
Dosvedanya mio bambino
Dosvedanya mio bambino
There is a place where only you alone go
There is a world that only you alone know

Along an endless balcony
Above the Adriatic Sea
I try to storm the Kremlin of your heart
In Florence, we were on the mend
But that Mazurka had to end
We missed the naked trees of Gorky Park

But all, will you ever know what you've lost?
Dosvedanya mio bambino
Dosvedanya mio bambino
There is a place where only you alone go
There is a world that only you alone know

But all, will you ever know what you have?
Dosvedanya mio bambino
Dosvedanya mio bambino
There is a place where only you alone go
There is a world that only you alone know

I heard you finally settled down, in a warm Italian town
So I took the train to see you there
Your wife is sweet and you're well fed
Your daughter, tucked away in bed
Still you looked at me with great despair
I hear snow is falling on Red Square

Valderi valdera
Valderi valdera
Valderi valdera
My knapsack on my back

Valderi valdera
Valderi valdera
Valderi valdera
My knapsack on my back---Lyrics submitted by Ian.
