Every-thing's so blurry, and every-one's so fake,
and everything is empty, and everything is so messed up.
Preoccupied without you, I cannot live at all,
My whole world surrounds you, I stumble, then I crawl.
You can be my someone, you could be my seed,
to know that I'll protect you from all of the obscene.
I wonder what you're doing, imagine where you are,
There's Oceans in between us, but that's not very far. 

    Can you take it all away, Can you take it all away,
    When you shoved it in my face, this pain you gave to me.
    Can you take it all away, Can you take it all away,
    When you shoved it in my face.

And everyone is changing, there's no one left that's real,
So make up you own ending, and let me know just how you feel.
Cause I am lost without you, cannot live at all, 
My whole world surrounds you, I stumble then I crawl. 
You can be my someone, you can be my seed,
You know that I will save you, from all of the obscene. 
I wonder what you're doing, I wonder where you are,
There's oceans in between us, but that's not very far.

    Can you take it all away, Can you take it all away, 
    When you shoved it in my face, this pain you gave to me.
    Can you take it all away, Can you take it all away,
    When you shoved it in my face, this pain you gave to me.

Oh - - - - nobody told me what you thought, Nobody told me what to say,
Everyone showed you where to turn, told you when to run away.
Nobody told you where to hide, nobody told you what to say,
Everyone showed you where to turn, told you where to run away.---Lyrics submitted by Thomas DeHart.
