Yeah Alright Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah (echo)

A long time ago in a galaxy far awasted
I'm basted come on yeah
Im in the floor and I got all
The flavors you tasted
With sweat dripping down your little back

Cause all night long, said
All night long I been thinking...
About how to get your clothes on the floor

All night long, said
All night long, I been drinking
About how to get your panties on the floor

So lets get it over and just get naked
With sweat dripping down your little back

Im a Holy roller and I own the spaceship
So let me take you for a little ride
Ride ride

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Alright

So Ive been on the go for so long
I cant stand up  Straight
And now tell me

Im in the floor and I got all
The flavors you tasted
With sweat dripping down your little back

Cause all night long, said
All night long I been thinking...
About how to get your clothes on the floor

All night long, said
All night long, I been drinking
About how to get your panties on the floor

So lets get it over and just get naked
With sweat dripping down your little back

Im a Holy roller and I own the spaceship
So let me take you for a little ride
Ride ride

Come on, come on, come on, yeah
You know I really want to take you
For a little ride
Come on, come on, come on, yeah
You know I really want to take you
For a little ride

You know I really want to take you
for a little ride
You know I really want to take you
for a little

So lets get it over and just get naked awww

So lets get it over and just get naked
I wanna give you everything I got
Im a Holy roller and I own the spaceship
So let me take you for a little ride

Lets get it over And just get naked
With sweat dripping down your little back
Im a Holy roller and I own the spaceship
So let me take you for a little ride

Come on, come on, take you for a little ride
