Dull, Souless aren't you? (repeatedly continuously in the background)
I mean......I was just trying to live my bloody life you know 
get from a to b and do a little shopping;
Only to find that infact life is controlled for me by 
bits of bloody, bloody buggery bits of paper, 
I mean why cant life just be made a little bit easier for everybody
You know and why do we pay bloody taxes?
I know, you know to buy railings to put outside bloody shops 
and stupid people cant run into the bloody road 
But you know, were not all stupid, we dont all need nursemaiding
Why dont we just have a stupidity tax and just tax the STUPID PEOPLE!

Its fabulous....good....thank you
