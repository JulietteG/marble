It is not easy
It is not easy

Looking from a window
at the back of a house
at the edge of a town
It's grey
like the day
when I lost it
Clouds overhead
I talked to a flower
that was almost dead
My body a prison
why did I do it?
Someone told me not to
but I still went through it

It is not easy
but don't give up now
It is not easy
Happiness is an option

Needed somewhere to clear my head
find some strength
a warmer bed
Maximum love in a minimal world
I'd never achieved it
but then I believed it
so when I lost it - how?
I'm not sure now -
it was a strange feeling
like a law repealing itself

It is not easy
But don't give up now
It is not easy
Happiness is an option
It is not easy
But don't give up now
It is not easy
Happiness is an option

I can wake up in the morning
and not believe what I see
Look in the mirror
And think if that's really me
I don't think I suit my face
It's not a catastrophe
it's more a philosophy
like the Russians wondering why
we're born under a blue sky
but die in a dark forest

Is is not easy
but don't give up now
It is not easy
Happiness is an option
It is not easy
but don't give up now
It is not easy
Happiness is an option

This is neither old nor new
It's always, forever
Somewhere between sense and ambition
pleasure and decision
we have to make a choice
What do we want?
Everyone singing 'War, what is it good for?'
while planning the next one?
I don't need to win
You don't have to lose
We can choose
Happiness is an option

It is not easy
but don't give up now
It is not easy
Happiness is an option

It is not easy
the war within us
but it gets easier
the more we learn
I don't need to win
You don't have to lose
We can choose
happiness is an option

It not easy
but don't give up now
It is not easy
Happiness is an option
I don't have to win
You don't have to lose
We can choose
Happiness is an option---
