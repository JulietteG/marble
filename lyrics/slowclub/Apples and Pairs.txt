Open up both your eyes
Stay mine shut, I don't mind
Pylons bust, right outside
But all I hear is you
Remember when it rained all day
No playtime locked away
Dancing to the beat of rain
Will it ever stop?

Cos we are a pair of apples
That we'd share after the stretch
But for fifteen minutes or so
We were there

Nervous walks in a park
I never knew could get so dark
I'm running out of things to say, will you please start talking
About yourself or your family
Any friends, I've got one two three
But they are all imaginary
Come and stroke the air

We are a pair of apples
That we'd share after the stretch
But for fifteen minutes or so
We were there

Brand new sheets, let's break them in
Underneath our feathered skin
I feel your warmth, you let me in
Shall we stop, let's stop
I look at you, you look away
It's the beginning of the end today
Three more weeks, and we could say
We mirrored the world

Cos we are a pair of apples
That we'd share after the stretch
But for fifteen minutes or so
We were there
