We've been over and over,
this thing we call love.
And I've been thinking about what my friends would say,
if I were to give it up.

Cause I've been tired and hopeful (I've been hurting inside)
For far too long now (too long now).
So I'm giving it up, giving up, giving up on love.
Giving up on love.

Hold back, you've got me all wrong,
and now it's like it's over before it's even begun.
You need to sit back and take it as a test,
if you'd given me straight answers I would never have had to guess.

Cause I've been tired and hopeful (I've been hurting inside).
For far too long now (too long now).
So I'm giving it up, giving up, giving up on love.
Giving up on love.

And it was obvious from the start,
we were the only ones with hearts.
And you pull mine apart,
with the things that you do.
The house was falling from the cliffs,
it is only glass and brick,
if you throw enough it sticks.
I learnt that before,
it's a battle not a war.

Cause we've been over and over,
this thing we call love.
And I've been thinking about what my friends would say,
if I were to give it up.

Cause I've been tired and hopeful (I've been hurting inside)
For far too long now (too long now)
So I've given it up, given up, given up on love
Giving up on love (giving up, giving up)
Giving up on love (giving up, giving up)
Giving up on love (giving up, giving up)
Giving up on love (giving up, giving up)
Giving up on love
Giving up on love (giving up, giving up)

Giving up on love (giving up, giving up)
Giving up on love (giving up, giving up)
Giving up on love (giving up, giving up)
Giving up on love (giving up, giving up)
Giving up on love.
