Sun is coming up slowly,
I didn't read it in your star-sign or mine.
God knows we're not holy,
in decisions we make,
and how we spend our time.

But I got faster and faster,
and you got harder to please,
and you got harder to find.
And our prayers were answered,
when we wrote these songs,
and we lost our minds.
And all our most brilliant friends are doubting themselves.

And we're scared about the world,
the atmosphere, our bodies, and our health.

So just dance with me
move your body round this time machine
start it again.
I want you to celebrate,
the fact our bodies can recreate
new versions of ourselves.
We won't need help.

Something's making me nervous,
running through my body,
can't remember why.
We thought we had all the answers,
we got the stomach to learn,
but haven't got the time.

Your body looks good tonight
I wonder if you'd care,
if I was still in your shirt.
The way we were when we first met,
before your mind filled with air and mine with dirt.
And all our most brilliant friends are doubting themselves.


And we're scared about the world,
the atmosphere, our bodies, and our health.

So just dance with me
move your body round this time machine
start it again.
I want you to celebrate,
the fact our bodies can recreate
new versions of ourselves.
We won't need help.

Hey hey, look at him go
Hey hey, look at him go

Hey hey, look at him go
Hey hey, look at him go!

You know that it's gonna take time don't you?
you know that you never were right.
But the fact is you're good,
yeah, we know that you're nice.
But we don't get a world and we don't get a life,
where all our most brilliant friends are doubting themselves.

And we're scared about the world,
the atmosphere, our bodies, and our health.

So just dance with me
move your body round this time machine
start it again.
I want you to celebrate,
the fact our bodies can recreate
new versions of ourselves.
We won't need help.

Hey hey, look at him go
Hey hey, look at him go

Hey hey, look at him go
Hey hey, look at him go!
