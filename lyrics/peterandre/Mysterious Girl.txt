Baby Girl.. I said tonight is your lucky night...
Peter Andre Along with Bubbler Ranx On the mic..


I stopped and stare at you walkin on the shore
I tried to concentrate, My mind wants to explore
The Trpoical scent of you takes me up above
Girl when i look at you... oh, fall in love 

Ooooh!No dought you look so fine..
Girl i wanna make you mine..
I want to be with a women just like you..
No doubt that i'm the only man who can love you like i can..
So jus let me be with the women that i love..


Baby girl.. Shine Like a looking glass

Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh
Mysterious Girl, i wanna get close to you..
(x2)


Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh
Mysterious Girl, Move you body close to mine..
Close to mine...


Girl you are mi Heart desire and you alone
a set me soul pan fire, mi tell them

Girl you are mi Heart desire and you alone..Watch this

Watching the sun go down, the tide is drifting in..
We can get closer now and feel the warmth within..
Cause I'm looking in your eyes, feeling so alive..
And girl when you touch me, i'ts time to take it through the night..

Girl i wanna be with you..
I wanna spend the night with you..
I need to be with the women that i love..
Girl i wanna do to you all the things you want me to..
I need to be with the women that i love..

Baby Girl let you loving release....

Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh
Mysterious Girl, i wanna get close to you..
(So close to you my baby)


Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh
Mysterious Girl, Move you body close to mine..
Close to mine...

Well i,ve been sitting by the phone hoping you'd call..
When time mi hear you voice i feel ten feet tall..


Body weh you ave vek de man dem a bawl.. Man i trip over man 
when time your name call..Pretty looks surround me like a flower of 
bloom.. And i love the smell of you elizabeth taylor perfume..

Your personality alone light up de room,, Just one kiss alone a make 
mi heart go boom...

Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh
Mysterious Girl, i wanna get close to you..
(Come on now x2)

Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh
Mysterious Girl, Move you body close to mine..
Close to mine...
