Ooooh, ooooh

Your my angel, your my devil
Your my lover, your my vice
So beautiful and bad, 
But i'm sleeping with the enemy, 
Where did my brain go? 
Thinking with my heart. 

You brought along your evil twin, 
and you let her take over this love - woah! 
And now I'm caught up in between, 
And I can't make out which one you are.

As bad as you are, 
Like poison your no good to my heart, 
But I need you girl as bad as you are
You got me crippled
Broke my defenses and I keep coming back to you
As bad as you are.

I'm your shower, I'm your tower
Marks from mascara, leaving stains
I'm your world at the bottom of your feet
Where did my brain go, thinking with my heart.

You brought along your evil twin, 
And you let her take over this love - woah!
And now I'm caught up in between, 
And I can't make out which one you are.

As bad as you are, 
Like poison your no good to my heart, 
But I need you girl as bad as you are
You got me crippled
Broke my defences and I keep coming back to you
As bad as you are.

But I can't blame you for what I've allowed,
Holding me captive to get your way
It's gifted with a curse, can't seem to shake it off
Still wanna stay with you, as bad as you are.

Like poison your no good to my heart, 
But I need you girl as bad as you are
You got me crippled
Broke my defenses and I keep coming back to you
As bad as you are

Like poison you're no good to my heart, 
But I need you girl as bad as you are
You got me crippled
Broke my defenses and I keep coming back to you
As bad as you are.---Lyrics submitted by Kirsty Sands.
