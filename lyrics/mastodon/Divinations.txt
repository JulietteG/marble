It's gone away, it's gone away, it's gone for good
And the spirit's shouting come Karelia
A primitive child of brilliant light, her magnet of wisdom is pulling
Pulling faster, the fabrics of time

No escape, binding spirits
No escape, trapped in time and space
Rabid descendants, a wormhole is entered

The sin of calypso surrounds me
The fire's dancing in the silvery sea of breath
Black rune, it directs me
Summoning the soul of the specter

No escape, binding spirits
No escape, trapped in time and space
Fire in the eye reminiscing majesty

No escape, binding spirits
No escape, trapped in time and space
Fire in the eye reminiscing majesty---Lyrics submitted by amit geva.
