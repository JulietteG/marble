AHH (x3)
Lesson 
honor the instinct of the animal
Pressure
no blame on the redbull
throw fury at him-
aim, gorge, and win
Less contenders on the way, today, let them pay
nothing lost nothing gained, today, let them pay
less contenders on the way, today, let them pay-....
Listen
here lies a warning to matador
black out
blood running on the floor 
don't bleed by accident-
burn...your...game plan.......---Lyrics submitted by cody.
