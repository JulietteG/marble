I got the blues when my baby left me by the San Francisco Bay,
On an ocean liner gone so far away.
I didn't mean to make her feel so bad, 
She was the best girl that I ever had.
She said goodbye, made me cry, I'm gonna lay down and die.

I ain't got a nickel and I ain't got a lousy dime,
If she don't come back I think I'm gonna lose my mind.
If she ever comes back to stay, it's gonna be another brand new day,
Walkin' with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay.

Sittin' out lookin' through my back door, Wonderin' which way to go,
Gal that I'm so crazy about don't want me no more.
Think I'll take a freight train 'cause I'm feelin' blue,
Ride all the way to the end of the line
Thinkin' only of you.

Meanwhile in another city, just about to go insane,
I thought I heard my baby, the way she used to call my name.
If she ever comes back to stay, it's gonna be another brand new day,
Walkin' with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay.---Lyrics submitted by Bob Ranney.
