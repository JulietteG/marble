Like sugar the sweetest thing I ever tasted
Like a fine merlot
And white pills cut on glass and lips of dolls
I'm told there was beauty in our silence
So hold me angel, love me angel

Kiss the sun and burn our lips dead radio
Candy girl you will never ever, ever make me the
Perfect killer
Outside the rabbit hole is a candy shop of poison

A velvet tongue demur is cast and melted
We are not alone
A creature stirs outside these paper walls
These gods are hollow and burned
Ignite this angel, love me angel

Kiss the sun and burn our lips dead radio
Candy girl you will never ever, ever make me the
Perfect killer
Outside the rabbit hole is a candy shop of poison

The sweetest thing I ever tasted...
Invite me to pray, let the music glow
Ignite my eyes and watch the poison flow

Say it with me: "We Are Ghost"
Not too loud, the Kingdom follows

Kiss the sun and burn our lips dead radio
Candy girl you will never ever, ever make me the
Perfect killer
Outside the rabbit hole is a candy shop of poison
Kiss the sun and burn our lips dead radio
Candy girl you will never ever, ever make me the
Perfect killer
Outside the rabbit hole is a candy shop of poison
Make me the perfect...killer
Invite me to pray and let the music glow---Lyrics submitted by Casey.
