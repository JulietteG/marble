The hunger dressed alone
Ten years have gone and past
A vision of carnival
Dark days Immaculate
Search the town of millions of smiling clowns
Red cat monster beauty has her hands in chains

Her eyes still glow like heaven
Broken, unsound, cut her wings off
The night: a vampire trademark
Dead man walking free

The dancing has created a fire
Two-headed strong man disgust, desire
Midnight (destruct)
Break bones (for hire)
Create (sickness)
A war for purity

The blood we shared
The love we cannot let go (I have you now)

Her eyes still glow like heaven
Broken, unsound, cut her wings off
The night: a vampire trademark
Dead man walking free

We won't turn to dust...

In all its glory, and kept in secret cooks closed
with wax
the dark angels will retreat, and return to hell...

Her eyes still glow like heaven
Broken, unsound, cut her wings off
The night: a vampire trademark
Dead man walking free
Her eyes still glow like heaven
Broken, unsound, cut her wings off
The night: a vampire trademark
Dead man walking free

Midnight, destruct, let go
We won't turn to dust---Lyrics submitted by Kla.
