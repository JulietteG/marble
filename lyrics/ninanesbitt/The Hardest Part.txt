Pretend youre happy, pretend were fine
I guess thats easier after all this time
Talk about other girls then look in my eyes
I know you still hold on to us inside
But we watched that butterfly fly

[CHORUS]
Id give anything just to be with you again but its not the right time
And Id give anything just to feel you on my skin
But its not the right time and itll never be the right time, will it?
And it might never be the right time and thats the hardest part of it
(And it might never be the right time, thats the hardest part of it)

I keep you in my mind even though youve gone
Holding on to nothings easier than letting go
Stuck in the memory of what has been
Just please dont love another like you loved me
Cause time doesnt heal, it just leaves me asking why

[CHORUS]
Id give anything just to be with you again but its not the right time
And Id give anything just to feel you on my skin
But its not the right time and itll never be the right time, will it?
And it might never be the right time and thats the hardest part of it
(And it might never be the right time, thats the hardest part of it)

And I dont know why I feel this way
If I could Id change, believe me
I know that you feel the same, is it too late for saving?
Oh here I go again

[CHORUS]
Id give anything just to be with you again but its not the right time
And Id give anything just to feel you on my skin
But its not the right time and itll never be the right time, will it?
And it might never be the right time and thats the hardest part of it
(And it might never be the right time, thats the hardest part of it)---
