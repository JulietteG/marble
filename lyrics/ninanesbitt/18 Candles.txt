Put your pictures in the scrapbook
Keep your posters on the wall
Save your pennies in your pocket
'Cause the pressure's on us all
Oh, oh, it's just begun

Keep your friends by your shoulder
Save your lovers in your heart
Put your enemies behind your back
That's where they always are
Oh, oh, it's just begun

Now I'm 18 seeing something I've never seen
When I was 16, thought I knew it all
Now I'm 18 walking through the fire and it fuels me
I've 18 candles left to burn

Draw an outline in the sketch book
Erase all your regrets
You go behind the bike shed
To smoke a cigarette
Oh, oh, it's just begun

Emotions like a pick 'n' mix
Don't know what you're gonna get
You're crying to the mirror now
It's all just in your head
Oh, oh, it's just begun

Now I'm 18 seeing something I've never seen
When I was 16, thought I knew it all
Now I'm 18 walking through the fire and it fuels me
I've 18 candles left to burn

13 candles, watch them burn
14 candles, soon you'll learn
15 candles, watch them burn
16 candles, soon you'll learn
17 candles, watch them burn
18 candles, it's my turn

Now I'm 18 seeing something I've never seen
When I was 16, thought I knew it all
Now I'm 18 walking through the fire and it fuels me
I've 18 candles left to burn

Now I'm 18 seeing something I've never seen
When I was 16, thought I knew it all
Now I'm 18 walking through the fire and it fuels me
I've 18 candles left to burn
I've 18 candles left to burn
I've 18 candles left to burn ---
