He's got a Rolling Stones tee
But he only knows one song
They think they're from the sixty's
But they were born in 1991

There's a man standing in the corner
No one knows quite where he's from
There's a fight between Jill and Lorna
She's got a tattoo of a peace sign on her thumb
All that and the night has just begun

Stay out tonight and see through my eyes
Stay out this time, and we'll be home by five
Stay out, stay out, stay out
Stay out, stay out, stay out

Checkered shirts and chino trousers
Is this some kind of uniform?
It seems that they think they're gangsters
They barely started 6th form

She thinks she's in Barbados
But outside it's minus three
There's a guy outside I'm avoiding
I think that he shares a mystery
That time when he whispered to me

Stay out tonight and see through my eyes
Stay out this time, and we'll be home by five
Stay out, stay out, stay out
Stay out, stay out, stay out

Cause there's people falling in love around you
And there's people falling over their own shoes

All these boys and girls are people
Looking for someone to be
All these boys and girls are people
Waiting for their hearts to beat

All these boys and girls are people
Looking for someone to be
All these boys and girls are people
Waiting for their hearts to beat

Stay out tonight and see through my eyes
Stay out this time, and we'll be home by five
Stay out, stay out, stay out
Stay out, stay out, stay out

He's got a Rolling Stones tee
But he only knows one song
They think they're from the sixty's
But they were born in 1991---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
