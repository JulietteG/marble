 Remember morning always comes
As night surrenders to the sun
No matter how dark it may become
Don't stop your light from shining on
'Cause nothing's ever over till you say it's over
And nothing's ever finished
Not unless you walk away

You see I've got hope
So you could use a little, use a little
Leave it when you've done it
And I won't let go
'Cause a little bit, a little bit of itcan go a long way
Hoooo-ope hooooo-ope, hoooo-ope
I've got hope

It's easier to say you can't when you know you can,
It's easier to let go than to hold somebody's hand
But if you do, then you might just understand yeah
That it's okay to not know where you're gonna land yeah

'Cause nothing's ever over till I say it's over
And nothing's ever finished
Not unless I walk away

You see I've got hope
So you could use a little, use a little
Leave it when you've done it
And I won't let go
'Cause a little bit, a little bit of it can go a long way

I've got hope
So you could use a little, use a little
Leave it when you've done it
And I won't let go
'Cause a little bit, a little bit of it can go a long long way
Hoooo-ope hooooo-ope, hoooo-ope
If you need hope

Hoooo-ope hooooo-ope, hoooo-ope
 I got hope
I got hope

You see I've got hope
So you could use a little, use a little
Leave it when you've done it
And I won't let go
'Cause a little bit, a little bit of it can go a long way

You see I've got hope
So you could use a little, use a little
Leave it when you've done it
And I won't let go
'Cause a little bit, a little bit of it can go a long way

Hoooo-ope hooooo-ope, hoooo-ope (Can go a long long way)
I've got hope

Hope

Give me hope
I could use a little, use a little, use a little
I need a hand, I need a hand, I need a hand
You're throwin' me, you're throwin' me, you're throwin' me---
