Oooh (oh oh)
Oooh (oooh)
You will never find

Verse One
I can see you never loved me like
You say you did
I can see that I wasn't the one you wanted forever with
Please tell me that I'm wrong
Tell me this ain't what you felt all along
Baby are you happy all alone

Chorus
Cause you will never find nobody like me
One day you gon' see
Should've never let me go
Cause I love you so
Now it's time to say bye bye
Cause I'm all out of cries
Took this heart and for the last time
One day you'll realize someone like me, you'll never find

Verse Two
Now I ain't sittin here sayin that
I was perfect
But can you tell me
Is it really worth it
Do you want somebody else kissin my lips
Or do you even miss
Me holdin you close
i need to kno 
cause you will never find nobody like me

Chorus
Cause you will never find nobody like me
One day you gon' see
Should've never let me go
Cause I love you so
Now it's time to say bye bye
Cause I'm all out of cries
Took this heart and for the last time
One day you'll realize someone like me, you'll never find

Bridge
How could you do this to me
How could you do this to a heart that was yours
How could you do this to me
I can still see visions of you walking out that door
I still feel your heart beatin next to mine
Baby, I said baby
You'll never find
You'll never find nobody like me

Chorus
Cause you will never find nobody like me
One day you gon' see
Should've never let me go
Cause I love you so
Now it's time to say bye bye
Cause I'm all out of cries
Took this heart and for the last time
One day you'll realize someone like me, you'll never find

Nooo nooo
You'll never find
Nobody like me---Lyrics submitted by meika.
