INTRO: HMMMM HMMMMM 
HEEEEYYYY YYAAAYY

VERSE 1: LATELY, 
I KNOW ME AND YOU BEEN GOING THROUGH SOME HARD TIMES,
BUT I WILL CLIMB THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN, 
SWIM THE DEEPEST SEA, 
JUST TO KEEP YOU MINE,
(KEEP YOU MINE)
AND YOU ALREADY KNOW, 
WHAT I FEEL, 
WHEN I FEEL YOUR TOUCH
IT MAKES ME WANNA GET ON BOTH MY KNEES 
AND TELL YOU TAKE ALL MY LOE
BABY TAKE ALL MY LOVE..........

CHORUS: BABY BUT PLEASE....
BABY,
 PEASE DON'T LEAVE 
I KNOW I SAID A LOT OF THINGS 
BUT I'M SO (I'M SO SORRY)
(I'M SO SORRY) :(
I'M BEGGING YOU (BEGGING YOU NOT TO GO)
I COULDN'T STAND TO WAKE UP EACH MORNING 
AND NOT SEE YOUR FACE ANYMORE
BABY PLEASE.....

VERSE 2: 
I FEEL IT REAL DEEP INSIDE 
IT MAKES ME WANNA CRY 
I ASK MYSELF WHY DID I ? 
DO THOSE THINGS THAT I DIDN'T MEAN
ITS NOT TO LATE BABY WE STILL CAN SEE
IF IT WAS MEANT TO BE
ME AND YOU
AND YOU AND ME
BABY PLEASE.

CHORUS: 
BABY, PLEASE DON'T LEAVE 
I KNOW I SAID A LOT OF THINGS 
BUT I'M SO (I'M SO SORRY)
(I'M SO SORRY) :(
I'M BEGGING YOU (BEGGING YOU NOT TO GO)
I COULDN'T STAND TO WAKE UP EACH MORNING 
AND NOT SEE YOUR FACE ANYMORE
BABY PLEASE....

VERSE 3: 
EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES 
BUT BABY PLEASE DON'T ACT THIS WAY
I CANT FEEL MY LIFE WITHOUT YOU 
I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
LIFE'S LIKE A ROLLER COASTER 
UP AND DOWN
WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THIS 
I WANNA BE AROUND
I WANNA FEEL YOU NEXT TO ME
OH BABBBBYYYY 
PLEASE DOOONNTT
LEEAAVVEE

CHORUS: 
BABY, PLEASE DON'T LEAVE 
I KNOW I SAID A LOT OF THINGS 
BUT I'M SO (I'M SO SORRY)
(I'M SO SORRY) :(
I'M BEGGING YOU (BEGGING YOU NOT TO GO)
I COULDN'T STAND TO WAKE UP EACH MORNING 
AND NOT SEE YOUR FACE ANYMORE
