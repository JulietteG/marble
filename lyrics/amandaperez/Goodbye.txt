Nobody knows what you're going through
But I know this much is true
I need you in my life
I need you by my side
I wanna see your face
I needa hear your voice
And I know that if it's meant
I'll have no choice
But I don't want...
I don't wanna let you go...
'Cause I know deep down in my heart
I feel it in my soul

[chorus:]
It's gona be hard
God take my heart
'Cause I don't want it anyway
I don't think that I can take
Feeling this hurt
I'm feeling the worst
Lord give me one more chance
Let me do all I can
'Cause I don't wanna say
Goodbye...

[verse 2:]
I wish I could turn back the hands of time
I wish that I can take the pain
This pain and suffering out of your life
Now I'm here in memories
Of how things how used to be
Can't hold these tears from falling from my eyes
Can't hold this hurting inside

[chorus:]
It's gonna be hard
God take my heart
'Cause I don't want it anyway
I don't think that I can take
Feeling this hurt
I'm feeling the worst
Lord give me one more chance
Let me do all I can
'Cause I don't wanna say
Goodbye...

[verse 3:]
Hold me close
Don't let go
This can't be
Please no
It's not supposed to happen this way
You're supposed to live to see many days
With all your laughs
And all your smiles
I swear the angels can hear you from many miles
In my dreams he tells me but I already know
I just don't wanna let you go
It's gonna be hard
It's gonna be hard
But I don't wanna let...
I don't wanna let you go
'Cause I don't wanna say
Goodbye...---Lyrics submitted by Princess.
