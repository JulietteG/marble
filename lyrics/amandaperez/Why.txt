I Need Everybody All Around Do World To Listen
Im Going To Talk About What People Have A Hard Time Talkin About
Pay Close Attention

[Verse 1:]
Many Dayz I Cryed My Self
Many Dayz I Asked God To Take Me
Cause I Knew I Was Goin Down the wrong Road
Didnt Nobody Care aint Wanna Know...
Got A Bottle Of Pills Filled To The Top
Now I Dont Care About Life, ill Let It Stop
25 Years Old And Im Loosing My Mind
Trynna Take These Pills to take my life

[Chorus:]
Oooh Why
Why Do I Fill This Way
In My Life
O0o0o O0o0
And I Cant Lie
Some Times I Feel Like I Just Wanna Break Down And Cry

Why-

[Verse 2:]
Single Mom With Five Kids
And Uh
Still Thinking To My Self
Tell Me What It Is
Why You Stay Wit A Dude That Stay Locked Up
You Know He Got Hella Hoes And They Stay Knocked up
Tell Me Why Are You Giving Him A Chance
Cause Baby Girl You Know He Aint A Good, good Man-

[Chorus:]
Oooh Why
Why Do I Fill This Way
In My Life
Tell Mee can You Tell Mee
And I Cant Lie
Some Times I Fill Like I Just Wanna Break Down And Cry
Oooooooo Oooooooo

[Verse 3:]
Ummmm Quick To Cock Back You Hand
And Call Her A Bitch
You The Man Of The House And You Think Your The Shit
But Were You Go When You Fell Like Your Down In The Dirt
When You Go When You Fillin All The Pain And Hurt
And Where You Go When Your Pockets
Are Low And You Cant The Shit To Put In Own No More
Man I See boy You Lost To The World
You Forgot About You Son And Your Baby Girl

[Chorus:]
Oooh Why
Why Do I Fill This Way
In My Life
Oh Oh Oooooo Oh Oh
Tell Me
And I Cant Lie
Some Times I Fill Like I Just Wanna Break Down And Cry
Oooooooo Oooooooo

Oooh Why
Why Do I Fill This Way
In My Life
And I Cant Lie
Some Times I Fill Like I Just Wanna Break Down And Cry
Oooooooo Oooooooo---Lyrics submitted by Naomi.
