I'm so stubborn
That's how I got here
So alone
Feels like forever
I wanna swim away
And breathe the open air
But I feel so afraid
Then I hear you say

Hang on 
When the water is rising
Hang on
When the waves are crashing 
Hang on
Just don't ever let go

I'm so hungry
How can I stay here
Starving
For what I hold so dear

Like a hurricane
It takes everything
From me
Wake me from this dream

(Chorus)
Hang on 
When the water is rising
Hang on
When the waves are crashing 
Hang on
Just don't ever let go
Hang on
When you're barely breathing
Hang on
When your hearts still beating
Hang on
Just don't ever let go

Three days
Thirty years
So hopeless
Doesn't matter
Don't say it's too late
If you blink your eyes
The sun is rising
The sun is rising

Ohhhhhhhhhhh

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by VicTory Stanley.
