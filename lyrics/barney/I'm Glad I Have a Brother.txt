My big brother hes number one
When were together we have lots of fun
Sometimes he makes me mad
But Im glad, hes my brother.
My brother, my brother
Im glad I have a brother

My big brother hes my best friend
I love when were together
Playing pretend
Sometimes he makes me mad (grrr)
But Im glad, (thats right) hes my brother.
My brother, my brother
Im glad I have a brother
(And hes so cool)

My big brother's a dinosaur
And when we play I like to hear him rawr (rawr)
Sometimes he makes me mad (I do?)
Uh-uh, but Im glad (me too) hes my brother.
My brother, my brother
Im glad I have a brother (thats me)

My brother, (yeah) my brother (uh-huh)
Im glad I have a brother

BJ: Wow thats one great song 
Baby Bop: Thank you
BJ: Lets sing it one more time

My brother, my brother
Im glad I have just one brother

I was teasing, I love you BJ.---Lyrics submitted by Marjorie Magdaro.
