Oh, mister sun, sun, mister golden sun, please shine down on me
Oh, mister sun, sun, mister golden sun, hiding behind a tree
These little children are asking you
To please come out so we can play with you
Oh, mister sum,sum, mister,golden sun, please shine down on me

Oh, mister sun, sun, mister golden sun, please shine down on me
Oh, mister sun, sun, mister golden sun, hiding behind a tree
These little children are asking you
To please come out so we can play with you

Oh, mister sun, sun, mister golden sun, please shine down on
please shine down on
please shine down on
please shine down on me---Lyrics submitted by fanny choi.
