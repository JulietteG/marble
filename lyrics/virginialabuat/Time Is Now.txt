In the twilight of the morning your face I can dream
If Im singing of the raindrops everything reminds me of you again
and the end shows me wondering just how could I guess you
but I feel that I wouldn't be with you, my nightmare in the end

Trying to keep cool if youre close to me
searching for you in the faceless crowds
dreading my luck, if you love me not, stop, the time is now.

Trying to keep cool if youre close to me
searching for you in the faceless crowds
dreading my luck, if you love me not, stop, the time is now.

When you saved my soul I knew that I could want you more and more
Trully every song was dedicated to you and you alone
I imagine your hands holding me, make believe
And Ill write you more love letters, but Im melding back to me.

Trying to keep cool if youre close to me
searching for you in the faceless crowds
dreading my luck, if you love me not, stop, the time is now.

Trying to keep cool if youre close to me
searching for you in the faceless crowds
dreading my luck, if you love me not, stop, the time is now.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
