Verse1:
When i looked over my shoulder it got a little bit colder
its like i lost love from an angel and now im feeling like a stranger
abandoned,im stranded, i gotta get back to you
i called triple A, they said they on the way
times ticking fast gotta see you today

Chorus:
But if my time is up,let me know right now
i will find a way to go hard again
so im speeding, im speeding
im speeding,im speeding
oh,oh,oh,whoa
oh,oh,oh,whoa

Verse 2:
iight, no time too be patient, jus got the conformation
and now im flying down the highway,she crying "try love my way"
im wit it (so wit) committed, to ride away wit chu girl
and give you what yu need more than your eyes could ever see

Chorus:
But if my time is up let me know right now
i will find a way to go hard again
so im speeding im speeding
speeding im speeding
time's moving fast but not fast enough so im speeding(speeding)
im racing fast but not fast enough so im speeding(speeding) 
im doing 90 down the highway
gotta make this turn up in the driveway baby
im bout to come at your door
oh baby open,there you go
i gotta scoop you in my arms
but if my time is up let me know right now
i will find a way to go hard again
so im speeding im speeding
speeding im speeding

oh! speeding(speeding) speeding(speedin,speeding,speeding)
