I done cut the braids, low cut, got my grown on
Had a sister label, Young Money, Money, long, long
I be so L.A. got my Chucks and my Locs on
I was in MIA, and MIA Superman on

I know I got it, I know she on it
I know you see it, I know she want it
She got that Cali good and she kinda hood
She got me policin' and wishin' that a nigga would

This lil' mama got her back right
She be skatin' on it, got a nigga singin' flashlight
They be trying to get her, but she be holdin' on hella tight
I got to act right, that's what she like

I get it in, I get it in
I get it in, I get up in i get it again and again
I get it in, I get it in
I get it in, I get it in again and again

Done with them boys, 'cause she done found a man now
Ain't no competition, she fumble when it hangs down
I'mma show her love, love, even when when my fans 'round
Get into the music baby, tell me how my bass sound

I know I got it, I know she on it
I know you see it, I know she want it
She got that Cali good and she kinda hood
She got me policin' and wishin' that a nigga would

This lil' mama got her back right
She be skatin' on it, got a nigga singin' flashlight
They be trying to get her, but she be holdin' on hella tight
I got to act right, that's what she like

I get it in, I get it in
I get it in, I get up in the game
I get it in, I get it in
I get it in, I get up in the thing
Get it

Fresh out my Bugatti, Polo on my body
I'm jumpin' in this shit like a pogo on a potty
So she come and talk to me like K-Ci, JoJo, and Devante
I say, "Hi, my name is Weezy and I know you know Omarion"

I get it in like parking spots
And they say money talks so don't ask me why I talk a lot
Girl, I'll kiss your softest spot, I'll buy your apartment out
Actually I just bought a house, I get it in then walk them out

I done got them dreads braided up, hair long, long
And I'm with a red don, that don't want to leave her thong on
Its too big, its too wide, it wont fit but

I get it in, I get it in
I get it in, I get up in the game
I get it in, I get it in
I get it in, I get up in the thing
Get it
