Verse 1:]
It Started Out Like Any Other Day 
But It Was Anything But 
Somethin Bout The Way The Moon Was Shining 
Somethin Seems So Different No 
Got In My Car But Didnt Have No Reason 
Swear I Was Driving But Somethin Else Was Leadin Me 
Lost All Track Of Time 
Damn 
The Next Thing You Wont Believe 

[Hook:]
At 9:00 I Saw Her 
By 10 I Had Her Number 
11 Is When I Called Her 
At 12:00 It Happened I Gotta Blame 

[Chrous:]
Midnight 
I Was Caught Up It's Like I Couldn't Help Myself If I Wanted To 
Midnight 
If She Found Out About Us Would It Be A Good Excuse 
Midnight 
12:00 Tick Tock Tick The Clothes Drop Shes On Top And I Dont Even Wanna Stop No 
Made Me Disregrad Her And Break My Baby's Heart 
I Know I Did Wrong But I Blame It On Midnight 

[Verse 2:]
Still Here I Know Im In Trouble 
But Imma Finish What I Started 
My Heart Is Tellin Me To Leave Here 
But My Body's Saying Stay Longer 
We Going Strong While My Cell Phone's Blowing Up 
I Know It's Wrong But Somethin Else Is Leading Me 
Lost All Track Of Time 
Damn 
The Sex Is Just Too Good To Leave 

At 1:00 Im In It 
2:00 Still In It 
Then 3:00 Im Finished 
At 4:00 Im Driving Home I Gotta Blame 

[Chourus:]
Midnight 
I Was Caught Up It's Like I Couldn't Help Myself If I Wanted To 
Midnight 
If She Found Out About Us Would It Be A Good Excuse 
Midnight 
12:00 Tick Tock Tick The Clothes Drop Shes On Top And I Dont Even Wanna Stop No 
Made Me Disregrad Her And Break My Baby's Heart 
I Know I Did Wrong But I Blame It On Midnight 

[Bridge:] 
What Have Ya Done It's 5 Am Oh 
Hooking Up Wit Somebody That You Don't Even Know 
How You Gonna Get Yourself Outta This One 
You Gotta Girl At Home 
I Can Blame It On My Car Breaking Down Or I Can Say I Was Workin Late And Didnt Know 
That You Was Waiting Up I Never Showed Up 
Girl I Know Its My Fault---Lyrics submitted by Alicia.
