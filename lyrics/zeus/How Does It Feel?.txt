Waiting for your chance to get away
Planning your escape for days and days
You can feel the Earth under your feet
You are like a dog who roams the streets

And how does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
That you can't make them feel your love
No you can't make them feel your love
Your love

Even your own mother let you go
Your sisters and your brothers gave up hope
Friends you didn't have 'cause you were cruel
And because you've never been to school

And how does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
That you can't make them feel your love
No you can't make them feel your love
Your love

She got a letter from the postman
You run to tell her you were safe
That made her cry because she knows that
Everything you've ever said was fake

How does it feel? (That you can't feel)
How does it feel? (That you don't know)
How does it feel? (That you can't make them feel your love)
That you can't make them feel your love
No you can't make them feel your love
Your love---Lyrics submitted by Eric Inostroza.
