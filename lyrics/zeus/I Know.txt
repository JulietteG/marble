If I wasn't the same as I was
On that day when I finally said
What I wanted to say all those years
I have so many favours 'round here

If I remembered that day that we dreamt
Would I still wanna know what it meant?
In the eyes of the hungry we lend
From eating too much

And I know, yeah I know
How it feels, how it feels
And I know, now I know
How it feels
And I know, yeah I know
How it feels, how it feels
And I know, yeah I know
How it feels

Oooo-oo
Oooo-oo
Oooo-oo
Oooo-oooo-oo

Do we still have the ticket to go
As far as we're needing to go?
Will they let us get off in between?
Are you struggling to know what I mean?

If I remembered that day that we dreamt
Would I still wanna know what it meant?
In the eyes of the hungry we lend 
From feeding too much

And I know, yeah I know
How it feels, how it feels
And I know, now I know
How it feels
And I know, now I know
How it feels, how it feels
And I know, yeah I know
How it feels
