Lovely and lonely but I don't wanna play here anymore
Don't wanna hurt her anymore
Isn't it enough?

Perfect and sweetly I won't pick up the hand piece anymore
I don't believe you anymore
Wouldn't understand

Locked in a feeling
Lost in the meaning
Feel the fever of the time
That isn't mine
Isn't mine

It could be e-e-e-e-easier to close my heart to you
But that's the one thing I could never do

(Oooooooooooooooo...)

Maybe their story ends in something happier than this
Maybe it's something that I missed
I wish that I could see her now

When all the dust clears the memory 'till nothing is the same
I'll still remember what she'd say
You know that I still feel her smile

Locked in a feeling
Lost in the meaning
Feel the fever of the time
That isn't mine
Isn't mine

It could be e-e-e-e-easier to close my heart to you
But that's the one thing I could never do---Lyrics submitted by Eric Inostroza.
