I thought you should know
I don't want to let go
Since you're all I ever dreamed of
What will you do to make me want to

Just don't ever try
To find out why
I always keep you waiting
Some things are better left unknown

-Chorus-
When I fall
If I fall
Darling, hold me
'Cuz when I fall
If i fall
I will take you with me 
(x2)

You mean the world to me so
I'm gonna let go
I need you to cling to
What will you do to make me stop?

Just don't ever try to find out why
I always leave you hanging
Some things are better left unknown

Chorus (x4)---Lyrics submitted by Carlene.
