Lost in skies of powdered gold
Caught in clouds of silver ropes
Showered by the empty hopes
As I tumble down, falling fast to the ground

I know I'll wither so peel away the bark
Because nothing grows when it is dark
In spite of all my fears, I can see it all so clear
I see it all so clear

Cover your crystal eyes
And feel the tones that tremble down your spine
Cover your crystal eyes
And let your colours bleed and blend with mine

Making waves in pitch black sand
Feel the salt dance on my hands
Raw and charcoal coloured thighs feel so cold
And my skin feels so paper-thin

But I'm okay in see-through skin
I forgive what is within
Because I'm in this house
I'm in this home
All my time---
