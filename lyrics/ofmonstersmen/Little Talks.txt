Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you, my dear
The stairs creak as I sleep, it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes

Some days I can't even trust myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary, this
ship will carry our bodies safe to shore.

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Well tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will all be over, buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young, and
full of life and full of love

Some days I feel like I'm wrong when I am right
Your mind is playing tricks on you my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary, this
ship will carry our bodies safe to shore. Hey!

Don't listen to a word I say. Hey!
The screams all sound the same. Hey!
Though the truth may vary, this
ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

You're gone gone gone away. I watch you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn torn torn apart, there's nothing we can do
Just let me go, and meet again soon
Now wait wait wait for me, please hang around
I see you when I fall asleep. Hey!

Don't listen to a word I say. Hey!
The screams all sound the same. Hey!
Though the truth may vary, this
ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Don't listen to a word I say. Hey!
The screams all sound the same. Hey!
Though the truth may vary, this
ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Though the truth may vary, this
ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Though the truth may vary, this
ship will carry our bodies safe to shore---Lyrics submitted by Cheryl Garza.
