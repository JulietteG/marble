Its hard letting go,
Im finally at peace, but it feels wrong,
Slow Im getting up,
My hands and feet are weaker than before.

And you are folded on the bed
Where I rest my head,
Theres nothing I can see,
Darkness becomes me.

But Im already there,
Im already there,
Wherever there is you,
I will be there too,
Theres nothing that Id take back,
But its hard to say theres nothing I regret.

Cause when I sing, you shout,
I breath out loud,
You bleed, we crawl like animals,
But when its over, Im still away.
A thousand silhouettes dancing on my chest,
No matter where I sleep, you are haunting me,
But Im already there,
Im already there.

Wherever there is you,
I will be there too,
But Im already there,
Im already there.
Wherever there is you
I will be there too.

Cause Im already there,
Im already there,
Wherever there is you,
I will be there too.---
