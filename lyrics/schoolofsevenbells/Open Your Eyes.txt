Open your eyes, love
All alone
Open your eyes, love
Weeping

I know that she was wrong
but life is moving on, so
Get it together, cause now anger is your pleasure
And the pleasure is the tether that fed you for too long
Now you're thinking that you're better
cause you think it made you strong, but
What you don't get
Is the colour of regret is the thing that made you sweat

When you tried to paint a picture of life in the future
When the present's too wet
With the tears that you wept long ago, fuelling the fire still
Keeping your head turned around in the past
Float in the present with the role that you cast
For her as the villain

And you, who came in last

It's time to wake up
(...)
Open your eyes, love
Cause you've been sleeping
It's getting hard to bear, watching you all alone
I know your heart is broken
And you've been weeping
But I've been waiting here patiently for too long
(...)
I know that she was wrong
and life is moving on
And the anger that you feed keeps you feeling justified
But turning a blind eye to the one who you survived with

And kept you sane through the heartache and the pain
What you don't get
Is the color of regret is the thing that made you sweat
When you tried to paint a picture of life in the future
When the present's too wet
With the tears that you wept long ago, fueling the fire still
Keeping your head turned around in the past
Float in the present with the role that you cast
For her as the villain
And you, who came in last
It's time to wake up
(...)
Open your eyes, love
Cause you've been sleeping
It's getting hard to bear, watching you all alone
I know your heart is broken
And you've been weeping
But I've been waiting here patiently for too long
You are my pain, love
You are my sorrow
Can't you see we're the same?
You got me crying
And now my heart is breaking
Cause I've been weeping
And I've been waiting here silently for too long
(...)
You come close, when you're in pain
Do you feel better, babe?
Then you go, cause you're afraid
You'll fall in love again
You'll fall in love again
You'll fall in love again
Open your eyes, love. You got me crying Cause I've been sitting here, patiently, for too long---
