Spoken, Emily: Roses, for eternal love. Lillies, for sweetness. Baby's breath.

Widdow:Why so blue?

Emily:Maybe he's right. Maybe we are too different.

Maggot:Maybe he should have his head examined. I could do it
.
Emily: Or perhaps he does belong with her, Little Ms.Living With her rosy cheeks and beating heart.

Widdow:Oh, those girls are ten a penny. You've got much more! You've got- You've got- You've got a wonderful personality!

Sung) Maggot: 
What does the wispy little brat have 
that you don't have don't have double?

Widdow:
She can't hold a candle to the beauty
of your smile.

Emily:
How about a pulse?

Maggot:
Over rated by a mile

Widdow
Over valued

Maggot
Over blown

Maggot & Widdow:
If he only knew  the you that 
weee-ee know

Widdow:
And that silly little creature isn't wearing
his ring

Maggot:
And she doen't play piano

Maggot & Widdow:
Or dance or sing
no she doesn't
compare

Emily:
But she still breaths air

Maggot:
Who cares? Unimportant! 

Widdow:
Overrated!

Maggot:
Overblown!

Maggot & Widdow:
If only he could see how special
you can be.If he only knew the you that wee-ee know

Emily: 
If I touch a burning candle I can feel
no pain,If you cut me with a knife it's still the same.
And know her heart is beating and I know that I am dead.
Yet the pain here that I feel try and tell me it's not real
And it seems that I still have a tear to shed

Maggot:
The sole redeeming feature from that
little creature is that she is alive

Widdow:
Over rated!

Maggot:
Over blown! 

Widdow:
Every body knows that's 
just a temporary state which
is cured very quickly when we meet our fate

Maggot 
Who cares?

Widdow
Unimportant!

Maggot: 
Over rated! 

Widdow:
Over blown!

Maggot and Widdow: 
If only he could seee how special 
you could be. If only he 
knew the you weee-ee know!

Emily:
If I touch a burning candle I 
can feel no pain, in the ice or in the sun it's
all the same. Yet I feel my heart is aching.
Though it doesn't beat, it's breaking. And the pain here that I feel,
try and tell me it's not real
I know that i am dead, but it seems that I still have some tears to shed
