Daddy lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die and I don't wake I'll be better than those who ain't
26, I'm a cool and intelligent hooligan
Native American noobie and cruising with [?]
Yeah they call me KB homes, I ain't talking real estate
Never wanted fame, I was told "eat what's on your dinner plate"
Don't get why being big is such a, such a (I'm into fame)
Think I'm reppin' Oklahoma no matter what
I'm still OK

Rollin' with my partners
All through Tampa, feeling like a boss
HGA behind me, I mean driving, and I'm on the aux
Take me to my hood so I can get that shrimp and garlic sauce
Let me go see my mom before you drop me off
Look, I remember just turning about 13 I promised
I thought it was over, I'm losing it all
I was riding my bike and then crossing the street
And then (car horn), hit by a car
My head went through the windshield, they pumped their brakes
I'm in the air
Knew they thought that I was dead
But that ain't what my father said
I'm still OK
I'm still OK
Fractured a couple bones, but I'm still okay
I'm still OK
God had a plan

Uh, there was a boy
There was a boy, on the same exact day
That got in the same exact accident
In the same hospital
And he never would walk again
What if it was me with the broken neck?
If it was over then?
I'm afraid of what happens next
Living like you'll never die, you'll die having never lived
Worried over making ends meet, forget you'll meet your end
I'm afraid of dying but my death almost welcomed me
I broke it like I do my bed, that's just how I enter it
Draped up and then dripped out
Street paving that 500k
Y East throwing my sins out
No regrets, just righteousness
And I can't wait to be like him
Life only gets better boy
With eternity on your eyelids
Imma sleep well, it's been settled boy

I'm still OK, I'm still OK
This gon' be a good night
I'm still OK, I'm still OK
And we gon' go to bed boy---
