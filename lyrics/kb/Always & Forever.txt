I can't imagine no one else right here with me
You got the magic potion scent all over me
Girl we got something special, take me to my knees
When I see you, when I see you
Oh, boy, it ain't nothin', nothin'
Tell me what you want babe, want babe
It's on me
Oh, boy, it ain't nothin', nothin', it ain't nothin'
I put that on me (I put that on me)
I put that on me (I put that on me)
Forever

To my summertime fine
Sublime mind, you're fine wine
...
Watchin' me drive by
My kind, my, my
Define time, I ... mine
Knowin' on me side, you hear me babe?
And as long as I live
You got both eyelids to see 25 kids
But I love the way you mother's so dope
No hocus pocus, a lot of focus to people won't
Now, spark the romance, got my heart on demand
I pull over, let's park ...
It's
How the boys hit the fan
I leave you when the Lord leaves your man
That's...

Always
Always and forever
Don't hold back, don't hold back
Always
Always and forever
Don't let go, don't let go
I say, don't let go, don't let go
Don't let go, don't let go
I say, don't let go, don't let go
Don't let go, don't let go

I don't know what tomorrow holds
But I know it holds tomorrow
I wanna be with you forever
But I know this marriage is borrowed
I'mma give it back, give it back
Remember that I presented that
At the throne that He be sittin' at
With these little acts and the grand drama divine
Let the world all see how He loves His ...
Listen, bad girls ain't no good
And the good girls ain't no fun
Girl, you ... the one
... is soaked in the sun

I can't imagine no one else right here with me
You got the magic potion sent all over me
Girl we got something special, take me to my niece
When I see you, when I see you
Let me love you

Why don't you come with me?
Forever, 'till the end of time
Why don't you come with me?
Forever, you'll be mine

Say, don't let go, don't let go
Don't let go, don't let go
Say, don't let go, don't let go
Always and forever, ever
Forever, ever?
Forever, ever
Always and forever, ever---
