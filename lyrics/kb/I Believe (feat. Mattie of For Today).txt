I (I)
I believe (I believe)
I believe that (I believe that)
I believe that we will win

Let me take it there
Please brag on what you did
How you smashed your first week sales
It ain't like your numbers make vaccines to heal weak cells
You brag when your money go somewhere besides yourself
I'm going with our voice
Where they got them brothers flyin' like it's PowerPoint
And then I'm going down to HaCo
With a chance to make it down a flocko
I'm with the Southside kids 'til they reach age
And then head for the Keys like spring break
Cause I believe that we intervene when it needs break
And go and be changed, then we talk about it
I get it poppin', pop it, you probably got a problem
Before they can stop me, gotta cut my power like I'm Amish
Hold the torch up high in the thick dark
The dream works no matter how bad the pics are
Cause I see how bad the globe is
But they don't know how bad our hope is
They don't know how bad we want this
It ain't where we at boy it's where we're going!

I believe that we will win, I believe that we will win
I believe that we will win, I believe that we will win
I believe that we will win
I (I)
I believe (I believe)
I believe that (I believe that)
I believe that we will win
I believe that we will win, I believe that we will win
I believe that we will win, I believe that we will win
I believe that we will win, I believe that we will win
I believe that we will win, I believe that we will win

They tell my young dudes that success is up to you
But that's hard when you got twelve years of wack schools
So it's rap or it's racks, either way you get them bars
When they give up we get charged
What's the system to our God?
We don't fight for the W
But we fight from the double you
Never said it wouldn't be trouble
But, but But he bring trouble to whatever troubles you
As struggles do multiple valuable things that are wonderful
We suffer through, hustle through all the things he wants to humble you
Humble you, take you and break you and make you into another dude
Take away any other truth, he's the one that can comfort you
Aight!
Wait on it, tomorrow We Live!
He's makin' all things new!
Makin' all things new
Tell the paraplegic that he gon' dance
Tell breast cancer that she won't win
Tell racism that he gon' end
What he doesn't heal now, homie he gon' then
Let's go!

Let me take it there---
