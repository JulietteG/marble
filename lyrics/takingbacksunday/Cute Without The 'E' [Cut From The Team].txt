Your lipstick, his collar.. don't bother Angel 
I know exactly what goes on 

When everything you'll get is 
everything that you've wanted, princess 
(well which would you prefer) 
My finger on the trigger, or 
(me face down, down across your floor) 
Me face down, down across your floor 
(me face down, down across your floor) 
Well just so long as this thing's loaded 

And will you tell all your friends 
you've got your gun to my head 
This all was only wishful thinkin, 
this all was only wishful thinkin 
And will you tell all your friends 
you've got your gun to my head 
This all was only wishful thinkin, 
this all was only wishful thinkin 
let's go... 

Don't bother trying to explain Angel 
I know exactly what goes on when you're on and 
How about I'm outside of your window 
(how about I'm outside of your window) 
Watchin him keep the details covered 
You're such a sucker (you're such a sucker) 
for a sweet talker, yeah 

And will you tell all your friends 
you've got your gun to my head 
This all was only wishful thinkin, 
this all was only wishful thinkin 
(the only thing that I regret is that I, I never let you hold me back) 
And will you tell all your friends 
you've got your gun to my head 
This all was only wishful thinkin, 
this all was only wishful thinkin 

Hoping for the best just hoping nothing happens 
A thousand clever lines unread on clever napkins 
I will never ask if you don't ever tell me 
I know you well enough to know you never loved me 
Hoping for the best just hoping nothing happens 
A thousand clever lines unread on clever napkins 
I will never ask if you don't ever tell me 
I know you well enough to know you never loved me 
Hoping for the best just hoping nothing happens 
A thousand clever lines unread on clever napkins 
I will never ask if you don't ever tell me 
I know you well enough to know... 

Why can't I feel anything 
from anyone other than you? 
Why can't I feel anything 
from anyone other than you? 

And all of this was all your fault 
And all of this 

(I stay jealous) 
I stay wrecked and jealous for this, 
for this simple reason 
I just need to keep you in mind 
as something larger than life 
(she'll destroy us all before she's through 
and find a way to blame somebody else) 
I stay wrecked and jealous for this, 
for this simple reason 
I just need to keep you in mind 
as something larger than life 
(she'll destroy us all before she's through 
and find a way to blame somebody else) 
I stay wrecked and jealous for this, 
for this simple reason 
I just need to keep you in mind 
as something larger than life!---Lyrics submitted by Anthony.
