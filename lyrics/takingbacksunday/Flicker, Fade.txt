If you should change your name,
I'll love you just the same
and if you should run away,
I would save your place
so you can go, go, go
if you want to I wouldn't try
and stop you
but I couldn't say I blame you

Flicker flicker fade, destroy what you create
and wonder why it always looks the same,
you wonder why it always looks the same

When I said "I hate that song"
about fire and sex you love,
I couldn't tell you why,
why I did it, why I lied
and I know it's wrong, wrong, wrong
it's evil but true it's what
I want to make you
(so I can say I blame you) so I can say I blame you

Flicker flicker fade, destroy what you create
and wonder why it always looks the same,
Flicker flicker fade, destroy what you create
and wonder why it always looks the same,
you wonder why it always looks,
you wonder why it always looks the same

You live your life, like you're not in control.
Like you're playing alone.
You live your life, like you're not in control.
Like you're playing all wrong.
You wonder why it always ends the same.
You wonder why it always ends (destroy what you create)
Wonder why it always ends ---
