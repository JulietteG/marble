Hey! [x6]

C'mon tell me that you're better
And you rather just forget
That things have gone so far
Yeah, tell me that you're better
And you rather just forget
That things have gone too far, oh

You're all I see
Sink into me
Sharpen your teeth
Sink into me
(Sink into me)
Sink in, sink in

Well I'd like to see our roles reversed
To watch you hang on every word
I'd like to see you have your way...
I keep my grammar well rehearsed
Correct each stutter, every slur
C'mon and have your way with me...

Now tell me that you're better
And you rather just forget
Yeah things have gone so far
You tell me that you're better
And you rather just forget
Yeah, things have gone too far, hey!

Hey! [x12]

You're all I see
Sink into me
Sharpen your teeth
Sink into me
(Sink into me)
Sink in, sink in

Well I'd like to see our roles reversed
To watch you hang on every word
I'd like to see you have your way...
I keep my grammar well rehearsed
Correct each stutter, every slur
C'mon and have your way with me
C'mon and have your way with me...

I'd like to be a note, the kind
You could sing but don't because you're shy
That way I live inside your throat
And hang from every word you...spoke

HEY!

You're all I see
Sink into me
Sharpen your teeth
Sink into me
(Sink into me)
Sink in, sink in

I'd like to see you have your way
C'mon, have your way with me
(And hang from every word you spoke)
I'd like to see you have your way
C'mon, have your way with me
(Sink into me)---Lyrics submitted by Simeon.
