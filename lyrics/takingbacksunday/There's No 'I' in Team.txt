Well I can't regret, 
can't you just forget it? 
I started something I couldn't finish 
And if we go down, 
we go down together 
best friends means, 
well best friends means 

And I've got a twenty-dollar bill 
that says you're up late night starting 
fist fights versus fences in your backyard 
Wearing your black eye like a badge of honor 
Soaking in sympathy 
from friends who never loved you 
nearly half as much as me 

Broken down in bars and bathrooms 
All I did was what I had to 
Don't believe me when I tell you 
it's just what anyone would do 
Take the time to talk about it 
Think a lot and live without it 
Don't believe me when I tell you 
it's something unforgivable...ohoh 

Well I can't regret, 
can't you just forget it? 
I started something I couldn't finish 
If we go down, 
we go down together 
best friends means, 
well best friends means 

You never knew 
well i never told you... 
Everything I know about breaking hearts 
I learned from you, it's true 
I've never done it with the style and grace you have 
But I've made long term plans 
based on these mistakes 

Broken down in bars and bathrooms 
All I did was what I had to 
Don't believe me when I tell you 
it's just what anyone would do 
Take the time to talk about it 
Think a lot and live without it 
Don't believe me when I tell you 
it's something unforgivable 

Is this what you call tact? 
I swear you're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back 
so let's end this call, 
and end this conversation 
there's nothing worse... 
(that's right he said, that's right he said it) 
I swear, you have no idea 
The jealousy that became me thinking 
(that's right he said) 
that you always had it way too easy 

Broken down in bars and bathrooms 
All I did was what I had to 
Don't believe me when I tell you 
it's just what anyone would do 
Take the time to talk about it 
Think a lot and live without it 
Don't believe me when I tell you 
it's something unforgivable 

Best friends means I pulled the trigger 
Best friends means you get what you deserve 
Best friends means I pulled the trigger 
Best friends means you get what you deserve 
Best friends means I pulled the trigger 
Best friends means you get what you deserve 
Best friends means I pulled the trigger 
Best friends means you get what you deserve 
Best friends means I pulled the trigger 
Best friends means you get what you deserve 

Best friends means I pulled the trigger!!! 
Best friends means you get what you deserve!!!---Lyrics submitted by john.
