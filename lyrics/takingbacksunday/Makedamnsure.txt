You've got this new head filled up with smoke 
And I got my veins all tangled 
Close to the jukebox bars you frequent 
The safest place to hide 

A long night spent with your most obvious weakness 
You start shaking at the thought 
You are everything I want 
'Cause you are everything I'm not 

And we lay, we lay together just not 
Too close, too close 
(How close is close enough?) 
We lay, we lay together just not 
Too close, too close 

I just wanna break you down so badly 
Well I trip over everything you say 
I just wanna break you down so badly 
In the worst way 

Well my inarticulate store-bought 
Hangover hobby kit it talks 
And it says, "You, oh, you are so cool" 

It says, "The shade across the bed 
You are red, violent red 
You hollow out my hungry eyes 
You hollow out my hungry eyes 

And we lay, we lay together just not 
Too close, too close 
(How close is close enough?) 
We lay, we lay together just not 
Too close, too close 

I just wanna break you down so badly 
Well I trip over everything you say 
Well I just wanna break you down so badly 
In the worst way 

I just wanna break you down so badly 
Well I trip over everything you say 
I just wanna break you down so badly 
In the worst way 
(Worst way) 

I'm gonna make damn sure 
That you can't ever leave 
No, you won't ever get too far from me 
You won't ever get too far from me 

I'll make damn sure 
That you can't ever leave 
No, you won't ever get too far from me 
You won't ever get too far from me 
You won't ever get too far from me 
(Ever get too far) 
You won't ever get too far 

I just wanna break you down so badly 
Well I trip over everything you say 
Well I just wanna break you down so badly 
In the worst way 
(Worst way) 

I'm gonna make damn sure 
I just wanna break you down so badly 
I just wanna break you down so badly 
(Damn sure) 
In the worst way 
(Worst way)---
