I was there when you were lonely
I was there when you were bored
I was there when you were feeling scared
and you were not sure what for
I was there when you found out
and you were madder than hell
You were scared, I was scared
but I did not let that show

'Cause you got me if you want me
You got me (It's right where I should be)

I was there when you were worried
I was there when you were sick
I was there when you were positive
that this was not happening
I was there with your father
oh he was madder than hell
he was scared, you were scared, i was scared
but I did no let that show

You said "It's my body boy, not your body look here"
"For Christ's sake... we're just kids!"
You said you didn't want to do it alone,
well who's to say you'll have to do it alone?---Lyrics submitted by Liz Gama.
