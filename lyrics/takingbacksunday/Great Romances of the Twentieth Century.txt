September never stays this cold
Where I come from
And you know
I'm not one for complaining
But I love the way you'd roll
Excuses off the tip of your tongue
As I slowly fall apart (slowly, quietly, slowly)
Fall apart

This won't mean a thing come tomorrow
And that's exactly how I'll make it seem
Cause I'm still not sleeping 
Thinking I've crawled home from wore than this

So please, please (please)
I'm running out of sympathy) (I'm running out of sympathy)
And I never said I'd take this
I never said I'd take this lying down

She says
"come on, come on, let's just get this over with"
She says
"come on, come on, let's just get this over with"
(I never said I'd take this lying down, let's just get this over with,
And I've crawled home from worse than this)
She says
"come on, come on..."

You always come close but this never comes easy,
I still know everything
You always come close but this never comes easy,
I still know everything
You always come close but this never comes easy,
I still know everything
You always come so close...
I still know everything, I still know everything, I still know

You always come close but this never comes easy
You always come close but this never comes easy
You always come, you come in close

I never said I'd take this lying down
I never said I'd take this lying down
I never said I'd take this lying down
But I've crawled home from worse than this

If it's not keeping you up nights
Then what's the point
Then what's the point
Then what's the point
Then what's the point

I'm in your room
Now is this turning you on
Am I turning you on? 

I'm in your room
Are you turned on? 

I'm on the corner of your bed,
I'm thinking maybe,
Are you turned on,
Are you turned on?---Lyrics submitted by Tiffany.
