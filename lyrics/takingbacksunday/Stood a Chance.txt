It takes so long
You're going forward looking back
A body like a welcome mat
You never even stood a chance
(On your own)
A body like a welcome mat
(On your own)
Going forward looking back
(Now you're looking back)
You never even stood a chance
You don't wanna know
You don't wanna know

You feel so safe, safe, safe
Being kept in the dark
(You know you never stood a chance)
You know you never stood a chance
Cause it's that same dark place
Where you'll get torn apart
(You know you never stood a chance)
You know you never stood a chance
On your own
On your own

(Hot damn tell me that don't feel good)

It takes so long
You're never one for looking back
A body like a punching bag
You never even stood a chance
You don't wanna know
(Body like a punching bag)
You don't wanna know
(You're never one for looking back)
You never even stood a chance
(Took a chance)
On your own

You feel so safe, safe, safe
Being kept in the dark
(You know you never stood a chance)
You know you never stood a chance
Cause it's that same dark place
Where you'll get torn apart
(You know you never stood a chance)
You know you never stood a chance
You feel so safe, safe, safe
Being kept in the dark
(You know you never stood a chance)
You don't wanna know

Fat and happy straight to hell
(Woo oou hoo)
In a body like a prison cell
(Woo oou hoo)
Fat and happy straight to hell
In a body like a prison cell
Straight to hell
You know you never stood a chance

You feel so safe, safe, safe
Being kept in the dark
(You know you never stood a chance)
You know you never stood a chance
Cause it's that same dark place
Where you'll get torn apart
(You know you never stood a chance)
You know you never stood a chance

Yeah in that same dark place
I will tear you apart
You know you never stood a chance
(You know you never stood a chance)
On your own
I'm gonna tear you apart ---
