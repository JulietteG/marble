(Eddie Nichols/Bill Ungerman)
Arranged by Bill Ungerman


I'm fly and flash and my jive is sweet
Pressed in pleat right to my feet
But when it comes to cash
I'm incomplete
Datin' with no dough


I told my doll I'd take her on a date
On the condition that she'd have to wait
'Cause I've never owned a car in the state
I'll be datin' with no dough


The valets and the maitre d'
Roll out the red carpet for me
My looks are deceiving Lord
'Cause when the check comes I'll be gone


Guess I'm deadbeat but what a seller
If flash were cash I'd be a Rockefeller
As long as my game goes unknown
I'll be datin' with no dough


I took my baby uptown
To show her that I had some class
The drink tab I could not pay
You know I ended the date with her foot up my
Yes I'm a deadbeat but what a seller
If flash were cash I'd be a Rockefeller
As long as my game goes unknown
I'll be datin' with no dough---Lyrics submitted by Jack.
