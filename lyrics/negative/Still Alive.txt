These are those days when i can get no sleep
I'm So tired i'd like to fall into sleep
I fall in my bed but still i'm awake
these questions in my mind are so much bigger than life
but my life is short i have to leave them behind
i have to try to forget
that i am still in my bed
in my deepest fears,i'm losing you
even if somebody tried to stop my heart
i'm still alive i wll never give up
just turn off the lights , dont wanna see me die
i look like i'm dead but when you look at me i am still alive
just open your eyes don't wanna see me cry
i'm right here where you want me to be
fighting with myself
all i need to feel is your breath on my skin
this endless longing between you and me
we can't give up now
we're gonna make it somehow
in my sweetest dreams i'm with you
even if somebody tried to stop my heart
i'm still alive i will never give up
just turn off the lights dont wanna se me die
i look like i'm dead but when you look at me i am still alive
just open your eyes don't wanna see me cry
i'm right here where you want me to be
fighting with myself
just turn off the lights dont wanna se me die
i look like i'm dead but when you look at me i am still alive
wont you open your eye dont wanna see me cry 
i'm right here where you want me to be
fighting with myselfi'm right here where you want me to be
fighting with myself..with myself ohh
i look like i'm dead but when you look at me i'm still alive---Lyrics submitted by rana.
