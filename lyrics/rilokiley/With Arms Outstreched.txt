It's sixteen miles
To the promised land
And I promise you, I'm doing the best I can

Now don't fool yourself
Into thinking you're more than a man
Because you'll probably end up dead

I visit these
Mountains with frequency
And I stand here with my arms up

Now some days they last longer than others
But this day by the lake went too fast
And if you want me
You better speak up, I won't wait
So you better move fast

Don't fool yourself
Into thinking you're more than you are
With your arms outstretched to me

Now it's sixteen miles
To the promised land
And I promise you, I'm doing the best I can

Now some days they last longer than others
But this day by the lake went too fast
And if you want me
You better speak up, I won't wait
So you better move fast

And some days they last longer than others
But this day by the lake went too fast
And if you want me
You better speak up, I won't wait
So you better move fast---
