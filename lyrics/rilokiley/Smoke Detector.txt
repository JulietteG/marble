my eyes burn everybody smokes,my eyes burn everybody smokes,
i smoke to but not as much as you,i do the smoke detector

there is a girl in a tank top,she is not wearing a bra,she looks so hot on the dance floor,she does the smoke detector

she says danger to the smoke detector 
she says danger im the smoke detect-or

i took a man back to my room i was smokin him in bed,yeah i was smokin in bed this what he said
i took a man back to my room i was smokin in bed,yeah i was smokin in bed this is what he said,i said danger to the smoke detector,i said danger to the smoke detector

i said danger to the smoke detector

i said danger to the smoke detect-or


i said danger to the smoke detector,danger to the smoke detector

i said danger to the smoke detector,i said danger to the smoke detect-or---Lyrics submitted by vanessa.
