don't have the words, if they even exist
I don't have a clue how to fix this
The only thing I know is you're the one I need
So I can't figure out why you've got to leave

Cause every time the day turns into night
Oh the same thing keeps running through my mind

Darling please come home, please come home, please come home to me
Darling, darling, please come home, please come home, please come home to me

You say that you're alright, then you turn your back
Well, darlin', can the truth be that bad?
Maybe this is not a perfect life
But it never will be without a good fight

Cause every time the day turns into night
Oh the same thing keeps running through my mind

Darling, please come home, please come home, please come home to me
Darling, darling, please come home, please come home, please come home to me

Oh, oh, oh (repeated)

Darling, please come home, please come home, please come home to me
Darling, darling, please come home, please come home, please come home to me---Lyrics submitted by Maggie.
