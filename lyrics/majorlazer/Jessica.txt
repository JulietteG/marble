My bathing suit is drying on the porch
My mother is crying upstairs
It's bad man, you're bad man
And all I want is my jessica

[Chorus]
You can let me off the leash
I won't come near, I won't come near
Teach me to burn, teach me to speak
I won't come near, I won't come near
Some girls they call the shots
Other girls might call your shots
But jessica you're that girl I love you lots
I love your locks, and your looks and your legs

And my physical looms on the schedule
I wanna be healthy for you
I hope it't not bad man, you're bad man
Cause all I want is my jessica
Mi jessica, my jessica

[Chorus]
You can let me off the leash
I won't come near, I won't come near
Teach me to burn, teach me to speak
I won't come near, I won't come near
Some girls they call the shots
Other girls might call your shots
But jessica you're that girl I love you lots
I love your locks, and your looks and your legs.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
