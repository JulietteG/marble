Never got love from a government man
Heading downstream till the levee gives in
What can i do to get the money
We aint go the money, we aint gettin out
Heading downstream till the levee gives in
And my dreams are wearin thin
All i needs relief
I need i need some sympathy
Look at me
I just cant believe
What theyve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
Look at me
I just cant believe
What theyve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream
All of my life been wadin in
Water so deep now we got to swim
Wonder will it ever end
How long how long till we have a friend
Comin down, feelin like a battery hen
Waves wont break till the tide comes in
What will i do in the sunrise
What will i do without my dreams
Look at me
I just cant believe
What theyve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
Look at me
I just cant believe
What theyve done to me
We could never get free
I just wanna be
I just wanna dream
Were all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
Were all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
Were all together in the same boat
I know you, you know me
Baby, you know me
I just wanna dream---
