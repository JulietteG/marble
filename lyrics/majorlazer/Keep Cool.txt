(Verse)
Late night, wake up
Im sick, Im stuck
Youre here, so near
Your dream my fear
Your love, my loss
Your dime my cost
My fate, your hands
My life, your brand

(Pre-Chorus)
Living my life in spite like you
This is the best that I can do
Nothing left for me to prove
I give it all to you

(Chorus)
Nothings what we made it
And were living like we hate it
I have given all I can
But I cant anymore
Freedom, I can taste it
And the truth, I need to face it
Ive always been dedicated
But I cant anymore

(Bridge)
Oh you know I love this kind of place yea
And no matter what youre still my lady
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I know youre fienin up here weekly lately
Ah boy youll find a stretch, youll never leave me
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

(Verse)
When you woke me up and you give me the sweetest wind up
Take someone to loving, if you be young to time uh
Yea, I figured why I was so blind now
Even though your hurt was under surface and me ignored your signs girl

(Verse)
Limbered and teared up, cant leave me like this
Just give me a chance for me to right this
Girl I know you live my love despite this
Cannot let you go, I got to fight for this

(Chorus)
Nothings what we made it
And were living like we hate it
I have given all I can
But I cant anymore
Freedom, I can taste it
And the truth, I need to face it
Ive always been dedicated
But I cant anymore

(Bridge)
Its not right cause youre saying this
I wasnt born to serve you
I was born to love

(Verse)
Your house, your rules
Keep calm, keep cool
Tip toe, steer clear
Your mask, I wear
Your wants, my needs
Loaded, good deeds
Your frown, my smile
Youre up, Im down

(Pre-Chorus)
Living my life in spite like you
This is the best that I can do
Nothing left for me to prove
I give it all to you

(Chorus)
Nothings what we made it
And were living like we hate it
I have given all I can
But I cant anymore
Freedom, I can taste it
And the truth, I need to face it
Ive always been dedicated
But I cant anymore

Anymore

Baby, and you get the reason
Baby, and you get the reason
Baby, and you get the reason
Never let it sit so long mandita---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
