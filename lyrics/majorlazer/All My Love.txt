(feat. Ariana Grande)

Some times I think we're the brightest stars
And I try to believe we'll find a way
Will life change, will our hearts turn colder?

All the rhythms in my heart lift me up inside
We can stay out of the trouble is it worth the blame?
Is it true that the more you give the more they take?
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say

All your love will make us ache
All your love is worth the chase
All my love I know we're waiting for this
All my love's up on the mountain top

All my love
All my love
All my love
Up on the mountain top

All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say
We're just a mess of broken people but we love the game
I would do anything for us, it's worth the pain
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say

All your love will make us ache
All your love is worth the chase
All my love I know we're waiting for this
All my love's up on the mountain top

All my love
All my love
All my love
Up on the mountain top

All my love
All my love
All my love
Up on the mountain top

You're always on my mind, oh there'll come a day
Day where we can fly, reach the glory haze
High up in the sun and the brighter sky, sun and the brighter sky

All your love will make us ache
All your love is worth the chase
All my love I know we're waiting for this
All my love's up on the mountain top

All my love
All my love
All my love
Up on the mountain top

All my love
All my love
All my love
Up on the mountain top---
