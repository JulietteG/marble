Feel the waters of the river
as you lay your burden down.
Healing waters of the endless river
can those waters still be found?

Feel the waters of the river
as you lay your burden down.
Healing waters of the river,
can those waters still be found?

There is a river
There is a river of life!
There is a river,
there is a river of life.

Feel the waters washing over
as you lay your body down.
Cleansing waters of the river
there his mercy's may be found.

There is a river,
There is a river of life!
There is a river,
there is a river of life.

There is a river,
There is a river of life!
There is a river, 
there is a river of life. (x2)

There is a river of life (x2)---Lyrics submitted by Simon Tice.
