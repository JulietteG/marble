The boss man and the boy's down at the job
have been letting me slide by
and this old hard hat that I'm wearing 
can't hide the tears falling from my eyes

While I'm hanging steel in Dallas 
Forty floors above park avenue 
From up here things look just like toys
and I realize how much I meant to you

Well I might move out to Denver 
a city that's already won my hide
But I lie a lot about leaving 
and the boy's all know I'm not afraid to climb

So, I'll just stay here in Dallas
chained to the place you set me free
'Cause loving you's forever
but, having you's a thing that just can't be

'Cause your memory climbs
High steel in the sky
and these day's I just don't care
if I live or die

Well, I just threw down a Winston
I watched it fall, till it was outta' sight
and then your memory hit me in the chest
and I wondered how it would feel to fly---Lyrics submitted by bentley lewis.
