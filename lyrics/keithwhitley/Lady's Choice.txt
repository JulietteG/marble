Its the ladys choice
shell stay or shell leave me 
shell fly like the wind 
or give up her wings
its in the ladys hands
it will or wont be me
my heart has no voice 
its the ladys choice
she built her a wall all to herself
so she could grieve
Im asking her now make room for me 
Its the ladys choice 
Shell stay or shell leave me
Shell fly like the wind or give up her wings
Its in the ladys hands 
It will or wont be me
My heart has no voice
Its the ladys choice 
Oh my heart has no voice 
Its the ladys choice---Lyrics submitted by julie t.
