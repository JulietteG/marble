I know you loved him a long time ago 
Even now in my arms you still want him I know 
But darling this time let your memories die 
When you hold me tonight don't close your eyes 

Don't close your eyes let it be me 
Don't pretend it's him in some fantasy 
Darling just once let yesterday go 
And you'll find more love than you've ever known 
Just hold me tight when you love me tonight 
And don't close your eyes 

Maybe I've been a fool holding on all this time 
Lyin' here in your arms knowing he's in your mind 
But I keep hoping some day that you'll see the light 
Let it be me tonight, don't close your eyes 

Just hold me tight when you love me tonight 
And don't close your eyes---
