It's the same old story
Boy meets girl then drifts apart
Though the plot line bores me
I know it's gonna break my heart
And you run on
And you run
And you run

I'm waiting for the heartbreak
I'm waiting for the rest of my time to come
I'm waiting for the heartache
I'm waiting for the rest of my time to come

And you run on
And you run
I'll take whatever comes

It's such a lame thing
I guess we knew it had to end
Do we say the same thing
Like I hope that we can still be friends
And you run on
And you run
And you run

I'm waiting for the heartbreak
I'm waiting for the rest of my time to come
I'm waiting for the heartache
I'm waiting for the rest of my time to come

And you run on
And you run
I'm waiting for the heartbreak
I'm waiting for the path that lies beyond

Are we doing the right thing
We'll just have to wait and see
It's been forever
We've been together
And it just wasn't meant to be

Maybe, baby, we're just lazy
Lately, everything seems hazy
Maybe, baby, we've gone crazy too

I'm waiting for the heartbreak
I'm waiting for the rest of my time to come
I'm waiting for the heartache
I'm waiting for the rest of my time to come

And you run on
And you run
I'm waiting for the heartbreak
I'll take whatever comes---Lyrics submitted by maggie.
