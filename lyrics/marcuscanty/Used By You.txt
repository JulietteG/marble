Youuuuuu 
Oh Baby, Oh babey 
Yeaaah

Used to be perfect,
But lately things ain't workin'
You know he's messing 'round you
I know how we can reverse it
You want revenge, you gon' serve it.
And we ain't wrong
'Cause he deserve it.
Right now I'm not your friend, I'm you lover
Yeah yeah
Let's turn this house into a circus
Then don't get mad, get even
You too can play that game.
You won't hurt my feelings
If you love me and believe me babe,
I wanna be used by you,
I really wanna feel on the side
I wanna be used by you,
Just call me when you get online.
And since your man ain't acting right,
Girl, I'm be all yours tonight.
I wanna be used by you,
Be used, be used by you.

Don't be shy girl,
I ain't tryna feel that.
You say you want that payback too asap
Baby, I don't mean what's on your mind.
But I really wanna see where
You're head at.
I'll throw this D... up on my Caddillac
And when I'm done, you gonna be
Like, boy you get that!
Girl, I'ma be moving your body like a boomerang
Girl, I'm gonna make you come back.
Then don't get mad, get even
YOU too can play that game.
You won't hurt my feelings
If you love me and believe me babe
I wanna be used by you,
I really wanna feel on the side
I wanna be used by you,
Just call me when you get online.
Oh baby!
And since your man ain't acting right,
Girl, I'm be all yours tonight.
I wanna be used by you,
Be used, be used by you.

So, baby if you need somebody to work that body
Hit me shawty, up on my side
I won't tell nobody.
Girl, and even if that's all that you want
It doesn't really matter at all.
'Cause
I wanna be used by you,
I really wanna feel on the side
I wanna be used by you,
Just call me when you get online.
Oh baby!
And since your man ain't acting right,
Girl, I'm be all yours tonight.
I-I-I wanna be used by you,
Be used, be used by you.

I wanna be used by you,
I really wanna feel on the side
I wanna be used by you,
Just call me when you get online.
And since your man ain't acting right,
Girl, I'm be all yours tonight.
I wanna be used by you,
Be used, be used by you---Lyrics submitted by Etta Yalartai.
