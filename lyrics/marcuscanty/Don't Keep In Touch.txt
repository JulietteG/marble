Intro:
Oh yeahhh

Verse 1:
Ah, she needed space, a bit of a break
But, how long does it takes
'Cause, sheen hit me up yet
Now sheen hit me up yet, ohh
She made up her mind; I say that's fine
But baby can't you tap my line, just a couple of times
But sheen hit me up yet
Now she's pretty upset, ohhh

Hook:
I'm just saying I... (wanna know)
I wanna know what she's feeling
(Wanna know, wanna know)
I wanna know what she's doing
I wanna know...
But me and...
Shawty don't even talk
Shawty don't even care no more
She don't even keep in touch
She said she'd call me sometime
Shawty don't even up
Shawty don't even ring my bell no more
She don't even keep in touch
But all my love is hers
Is hers
Is yours
Is yours

Verse 2:
Ah, it's getting hard
I even, went to her job and left a card
She was really upset
Ah, she said I played her like a puppet, ohhh
Say now baby what you mean, what's up with that
I need you bad, I need you good, I just need you back
Won't you come back to ya love mess
Ha, it's crazy you ain't hit me up yet baby

Hook:
I'm just saying I... (wanna know)
I wanna know what she's feeling
(Wanna know, wanna know)
I wanna know what she's doing
Shawty don't even talk
Shawty don't even care no more
She don't even keep in touch
She said she'd call me sometime
Shawty don't even up
Shawty don't even ring my bell no more
She don't even keep in touch
But all my love is hers
Is hers
Is yours
Is yours

Verse 3:
Unh, man it ain't like she on no 'Why be?'
Man it ain't like I'm really hard to reach
And after all her tears dried
She said I'm alright let's just ride
And I said okay
And now I'm listening to The O'Jays
Thinking 'bout my mo' them what they go' say
Why you acting like that
You know she'll be coming back

Shawty don't even talk
Shawty don't even care no more
She don't even keep in touch
She said she'd call me sometime
Shawty don't even up
Shawty don't even ring my bell no more
She don't even keep in touch
But all my love is hers
Is hers
Is yours
Is yours

Outro:
I'm dranked up and dripped out
You've been what I'm talking 'bout
Dranked up and dripped out
You know what I'm talking 'bout
I'm dranked up and dripped out
You know what I'm talking 'bout
I'm dranked up and dripped out
Y'all n****s know what I'm talking 'bout---Lyrics submitted by LaTreal.
