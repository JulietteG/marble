La-la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la, la-la

Don't know the first thing about who you are
My heart is waiting, taken in from the star
If we don't go now, we won't get very far
Don't know the first thing about who you are

La-la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la, la-la

Don't know the first thing about who you are
My heart is waiting, taken in from the star
If we don't go now, we won't get very far
Don't know the first thing about who you are

La-la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la, la-la---
