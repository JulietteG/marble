Whats your story?
Why is no one true to you?
Your push for glory; cant you find your groovy shoes?
And that golden freeway; tryin to make believe youre a free male soon
You will be
Well, the endless scenic view, Im here to see you through
So be on your way, out on your way, yeah

Sos people talkin; theyre sayin things that just aint true
Well, you turn your cheek and walk away cause its all that you can do
No time to wonder, tryin to make believe youre a free male soon
You will be
The only intentions up above; He wants to cleanse you with His love
And take you yonder; and take, yeah, you yonder

(break)

Well, find a line, before I leave you here today
Yeah, you aint never gonna be that much when your souls so far away
Keep guessin; tryin to make believe your free man hassle
What's it gonna be; youll let it be
Love keeps goin on, well be comin throughout the storm
And thats your blessing; yes, thats your blessing, yeah, cmon

(break)

Well, whats your story?
Why is no one true to you?
Youre blessed for glory; cant you find your groovy shoes
When that golden freeway; tryin to make believe youre a free man soon
You will belonesome soon
The endless scenic view; Im here to see you through
So be on your way, and on your way, yeah

Whats your story?
Well, why is no one ever, no one ever true to you?
You have no ken to find your groovy shoes
When that golden freeway, makin believe youre a free man soon
You will be lonesome soon, its gotta be
The endless scenic view, Im here to see you through
So be on your way; yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah---Lyrics submitted by Bruce Carter.
