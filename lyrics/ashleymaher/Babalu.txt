ba ... ba ... ba ... babalu

babalu
found us both at home
in front of our TV

babalu
caught our tired eyes
from a documentary

I am the offspring of two orishas
I am dancing down here in Bahia
I have traveled sky-highways to teach ya
what each day, 
my orishas teach to me

oh,
ba ... ba ... ba ... babalu
ba ... ba ... ba ... babalu
ba ... ba ... ba ... babalu
ba ... ba ... ba ... babalu

babalu
spoke a poet's tongue
he had a painter's eye
he always left his lock undone
in case some friend dropped by

I am a worshipper of women
I'm a harbour for ships in the night
I have traveled sky-highways to tell ya
keep your heart alight

oh,
ba ... ba ... ba ... babalu
ba ... ba ... ba ... babalu
ba ... ba ... ba ... babalu
ba ... ba ... ba ... babalu

bahia's drums commanded us
by super satellite
to rise and dress like royalty
to cross the London night
the baby slept in a back room
beside a pile of shawls
rock-a-bied by midnight rhythms
rumbling through the walls

hip to hip
and cheek to cheek
his dad and I let loose
all packed into the living room
saved by the drum 
from the noose

the fires leapt to meet us
as we, in the ring, went wild
and babalu rose to greet us
with his orisha-offspring smile

oh,
ba ... ba ... ba ... babalu
ba ... ba ... ba ... babalu
ba ... ba ... ba ... babalu
ba ... ba ... ba ... babalu

don't lie awake
when it's time to sleep
but don't sleep 
when the drums are calling
when you break
we're the company you keep
from midnight 'till morning

don't lie awake
when it's time to sleep
but don't sleep 
when the drums are calling
when you break
we're the company you keep
from midnight 'till morning
