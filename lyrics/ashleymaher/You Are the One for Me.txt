funny how 
funny how
my longing for you never changes
not like a flower, fresh for an hour
not like the life of the mountain ranges

cause the snow may fall 
and the fires may burn
the earth may rumble 
and the day may turn
but still the rock remains
beneath my feet

you are the one for me

funny how
even out of sight
Im singing to you cross the oceans
may you be warm
may you be well
may you beware of fearful notions

cause the snow may fall 
and the fires may burn
the earth may rumble 
and the day may turn
but still the rock remains
beneath my feet

you are the one for me

oh, hold a candle to the storm
open the flame, so soaked in the rain
old the mantle round whats born
floating away, yet still she remains
cause love outlives a thousand dreams
ghosts may line the rivers 
and nothing ever dies
cause change is never what it seems
under and forever is where the rock lies

funny how
every now and then
I wake to the ways of the seasons
from flower to frost
from power to powers cost
love won or lost for countless reasons

for the snow may fall 
and the fires may burn
the earth may rumble 
and the day may turn
but still the rock remains
beneath my feet

you are the one for me
you are the one for me---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
