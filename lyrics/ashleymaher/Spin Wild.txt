to you who choose
an unconventional road
throw caution to the wind
lose no more

undelivered packages
sit waiting on the step
under-plundered seams of silver
sit waiting
the undecided side of you 
is waiting, dont forget

the golden ring youre grabbing at
is already in reach
the answer in a bottles
already washed up on the beach
if youre ready to fly
life will teach you
dont forget

to spin wild 
spin free
pull in the nets 
of your secret sea

spin wild 
spin free
pull in the nets 
of your secret sea

to you who choose
an unconventional road
throw caution to the wind
lose no more

like a dancing bee
you paint a map to distant lands
in the frantic hope of understanding
but on arrival home
youre still alone on the sands
dont forget

the golden ring youre grabbing at
is already in reach
the answer in a bottles
already washed up on the beach
if youre ready to fly
life will teach you
dont forget

to spin wild 
spin free
pull in the nets 
of your secret sea

spin wild 
spin free
pull in the nets 
of your secret sea

if youre not
where you want to be
give what you got
your best shot
then watch 
what happens naturally
dont forget

if youre not
where you want to be
give what you got
your best shot
then watch 
what happens naturally
dont forget

that half of what is happening
is sitting in your hands
waiting for the day you say,
stop waiting
if truth is your vocabulary
they will understand
dont forget

the golden ring youre grabbing at
is already in reach
the answer in a bottles
already washed up on the beach
if youre ready to fly
life will teach you
dont forget

to spin wild 
spin free
pull in the nets 
of your secret sea

spin wild
pull in the nets
lose no more---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
