young man
sipping a small glass
of sweet gunpowder tea
young man
thinking if Id stayed
maybe his is where Id be

young man
two beautiful wives
and a house of this very street
amid the beauty
and the struggle of home

young men
younger ones waiting
for him to tell them more
young men
of the gold and the glory
they believe waits past that door

young men
theyve sensed it in the music
tasted it on MTV
youve been so lucky
so lucky, what about me?

lucky
what can that mean?
lucky lucky
you go and you gain
lucky lucky lucky
then come home to see
that whether you go or stay
no matter how much 
you hope and pray
you will lose as you will win

young men
wondering why his wrists
arent glittering as they should
young men
where is the swing
he could be bringing to this neighborhood?

young men
and why did he choose
that old basin over Parisian blue?
and why do his eyes start dancing to the music of this youth?

along those coasts
the sun doesnt set slow
like a stone,
it drops down all alone

when their sons and daughters go
they pack the dreams they hold
and they get on the plane and go
they get on the plane and go

young man
mosquitoes getting busy
as the day has turned to dark

young man
despite the lights, this city
still looks up to see the stars

young man
his glass is finally empty 
as the conversation flows
about the beauty and the struggle
of home

lucky
what can that mean?
lucky lucky
you go and you gain
lucky lucky lucky
then come home to see
that whether you go or stay
no matter how much 
you hope and pray
you will lose as you will win

you will learn 
and you will win
and will lose
and win again
and all along
youll sing a song
the legend of your soul
while those of you
who stay behind
must cultivate an open mind
great journeys can be made within
for those who do not go

lucky lucky
