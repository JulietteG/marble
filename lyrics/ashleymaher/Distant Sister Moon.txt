flat on my back
and clean as an OKeefe bone
warm under pink and all alone

skies on my ceiling
and roses ring the room
a circle of healing calls
from a distant moon
distant sister moon

my house is clean
my kitchen groans
with food for all
a free for all
of love and devotion tonight

oh tell me
who do I phone?
this fickle future
never looked so bright
distant sister moon
distant sister moon

its eight oclock 
my sisters san francisco time
her sun is rising 
while Im busy saying, 
Bye to mine
call her up when Im high or low
shes got the vision of an old soul

Im bathed in pink
my sun long gone
helplessly laughing on the telephone
my babies and their daddys 
due home soon
their path is shining bright
in a distant moon
distant sister moon
distant sister moon

its eight oclock 
my sisters san francisco time
her sun is rising 
while Im busy saying, 
Bye to mine
call her up when Im high or low
shes got the vision of an old soul

sometimes I am so so young
sometimes I am so so wise
shake the sleep 
from my dizzy dizzy eyes
watch the water go so calm
my moon sisters 
got her light on me, on me
distant sister moon

sister moon
sister moon

sometimes I am so so young
sometimes I am so so wise
sometimes I have just begun
to open up my new moon eyes---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
