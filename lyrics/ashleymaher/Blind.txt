oh, blind
open my eyes too wide
and I go blind

blind
open my eyes too wide
and I go blind

I wear a filter, 
light as chain mail, on my face
soft as chiffon
clean as the rain

it keeps the voices 
of this battered world, at bay
not seeping into blood and brain
evergreen evergreen

Ive been accused 
of being fearful of the truth
they say dont falter
let the winter water run through

a thousand nightmares
they spring forth from what Ive seen
reminding me again 
that alls not evergreen

oh, blind
open my eyes too wide
and I go blind

blind
open my eyes too wide
and I go blind

a cross, a star, a crescent
stitched upon a flag
the word of love
the words of the gods gone mad

we read the holy books
and dont know what they say
we should be fighting for a love
thats evergreen, not gray

so many altars
sitting silent on the ground
so many answers to our questions
dancing out of bounds

the letters of the mighty
littered at our feet
evergreen

oh, blind
open my eyes too wide
and I go blind

blind
open my eyes too wide
and I go blind---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
