a god in disguise
knocked at the door
of two lovers long beyond the war

they offered him all
and he wished them only good
and he turned them into 
entwining trees within the wood
yes, he turned them into 
entwining trees within the wood

so wise is the weaver
of two lives together
when they weather
the weather together
whatever the weather

the prize is the laughter
among the youngest leaves
when he turns them into 
entwining trees within the wood
yes, he turns them into 
entwining trees within the wood

I want to hear
that absolutely doubtless voice
in my head
shout when the sunset 
is heavy with red
when homeless is love
hopeless lies ahead
hear me,
remember the positive way
the suns sleepy now
but shell come another day.

inside sings the echo 
of songs that made you grow
they rise with the sun and they
sweat with the seeds you sow

I slide in beside you hoping
hoping that hell turn us into
entwining trees within the wood
yes hell turn us into
entwining trees within the wood

I want to hear
that absolutely doubtless voice
in my head
shout when the sunset 
is heavy with red
when homeless is love
hopeless lies ahead
hear me,
remember the positive way
the suns sleepy now
but shell come another day.

I want to fall in love with you, slow
both overnight,
and along the long road
like entwining trees---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
