oh I have a good friend
shes lean as a lioness
she knows not to drown when
he slides into silences

she told him she loves him still
and she knows that she always will
but the call of the distant hill
wont let her rest

I watched as the lioness
went searching for freedom
three blocks from the ocean
one floor from the earth

a little apartment
abandoned, but for floorboards,
clean oven and curtain
to warm her rebirth

chorus
she sensed the spaces
and their possible graces
Ill fill you with the color of morning
these corners mark my kingdom
my kingdom, for now, of one
this crown is mine alone for adorning

when we get together
we want one another
to help us get over
the call of the day

you fall and Ill lift you up
you bleed and Ill carry you
but I wont be able to
when my back breaks

chorus
she sensed the spaces
and their possible graces
Ill fill you with the color of morning
these corners mark my kingdom
my kingdom, for now, of one
this crown is mine alone for adorning




and I will feed my soul
from the inside out
put speed in my muscles from sleeping
and I will plant candles
in my eyes and my open mouth
to watch over this newborn kingdom
Im keeping

chorus
she sensed the spaces
and their possible graces
Ill fill you with the color of morning
these corners mark my kingdom
my kingdom, for now, of one
this crown is mine alone for adorning

no snow in the summer of adorning
no frost in the spring for which we run
Ill wake with the color of the morning
no kink in the kingdom of one---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
