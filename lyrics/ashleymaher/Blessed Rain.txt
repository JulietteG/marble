a word came to my window
and my window opened wide
she spiraled warmth around me
and settled by my side

invisible, her beating wings
rose gently to my ear
and the kindness
of her voice was so comforting
I cried, I fear

why
like the kettle we watch
so slow the medicines birth?
unhurried by the shout 
of our rhyming words
or our dancing feet on the earth

fling high your voice
you cant hurry the blessed rain
sing high your voice
you cant hurry the blessed rain

a word came to my window
as my uncrossable river yawned
she wove a bridge of golden thread
where the river spilled into the dawn

my candles melted to puddles
my shakers lay on the floor
Id all but forgotten the window
I was so busy beating the door

oh  why
like the kettle we watch
so slow the medicines birth?
unhurried by the shout 
of our rhyming words
or our dancing feet on the earth

fling high your voice
you cant hurry the blessed rain
sing high your voice
you cant hurry the blessed rain

muttering incantations
we kneel at the foot of the stars
casting bread and bottles upon the sea
for how long?  how far?

oh  why
like the kettle we watch
so slow the medicines birth?
unhurried by the shout 
of our rhyming words
or our dancing feet on the earth

fling high your voice
you cant hurry the blessed rain
sing high your voice
you cant hurry the blessed rain---Lyrics submitted by Ashley.
