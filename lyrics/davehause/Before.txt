There's a place I'd go
Before it all broke down
Where we carried on and carried the fire
But managed not to burn the sea or the town

Before we sharpened up our teeth
Before the crash and the shame 
When I could still hear your voice
When your tongue still knew my name 

But you left me there
With just a memory 
How do I feel your love
Adrift on this plastic plague of a sea?
Is this all of the grace you'll allow? 

I would kneel down low
Under stained glass light
To taste your body to taste your blood 
Then count the minutes till we'd reunite

Before the gulf turned black
Before this town got too close to the flames
When I would wait at the door like a dog
For you to wrap your tongue 'round my name 

But you left me here
With just a memory 
How do I feel your love
Adrift on this plastic plague of a sea

You left me here
With just a memory 
How do I feel.. feel your love
Adrift on this plastic sickening sea
Is this all of the grace you allow? 

I begged you before and I'm begging you now 
Will the slaughter convince you to stay?
The cross wouldn't hold you but this time you won't get away
this time you won't get away

Now I'll leave you here
Just a memory
You will not feel.. feel my love
Adrift on this plastic sickening sea

I'll leave you there
Just a memory
You will not feel.. feel my love
Adrift on this plastic sickening sea

This is all of the grace I'll allow
I begged you before, I'm not begging you now
The slaughter convinced me to stay
But this time you won't get away
You won't get away

There's a place I'd go
Before it all broke down---Lyrics submitted by Ral P. F..
