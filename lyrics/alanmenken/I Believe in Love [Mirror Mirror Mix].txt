I believe (x12) in love, love, love, love, love.

When you cant see the forest or the trees,
For all the colors of your dreams,
Just turn to friends their help transcends to love, love, love, love, love.

I believe (x12) in love, love.
I believe (x12) in love, love, love,love, love.

The winter's finally passing on,
The king is back, the queen is gone,
Come dance with me cause now we're free to love, love, love, love, love.

Tutu tururu tu tururu....

I believe (x12) in love, love.
I believe (x12) in love, love, love, love, love.

Tutu tururu tu tururu....
Love, love, love!
Tutu tururu tu tururu....
Love, love, love! ---
