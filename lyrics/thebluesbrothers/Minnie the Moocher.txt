Hey folks here's the story 'bout Minnie the Moocher
She was a lowdown hoocie coocher
She was the roughest toughest frail
But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale

She messed around with a bloke named Smokie
She loved him though he was cokey
He took her down to Chinatown
and showed her how to kick the gong around

Whoah (Whoah)

A hidehidehideho (Hidehidehideho)

She had a dream about the king of Sweden
He gave her things that she was needin'
He gave her a home built of gold and steel
A diamond car with platinum wheels

A zootibitididdly bitididdly bitididdly bitidooey
(Bitididdly bitididdly bitididdly dooey)

He gave her his townhouse and his racing horses
Each meal she ate was a dozen courses
Had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes
She sat around and counted them all a million times

Poor Min, poor Min, poor Minnie---
