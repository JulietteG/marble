And if you're listening, I miss you.
And if you hear me now, I need you.

Where did you go?
'Cause you're not gone
Everyone knows that something's wrong
There was a cut and I'm alone

I know we're getting closer
I know you're coming back for me this time
This time.

And do you ever want me, do you ever need me?
I know that you left before goodbye.
And it's okay, there's always another day.
And anytime you want me, anytime you see me
I don't think you meant to say goodbye
But it's okay, there's always another day.

Your voice comes in and now it's fading,
I can't believe this is so frustrating.
'Cause you never seem to understand
And you let me slip straight through your hands
And how does it feel to be alone?

I know we're getting closer
I know you're coming back for me this time
This time.

And do you ever want me, do you ever need me?
I know that you left before goodbye.
And it's okay, there's always another day.
And anytime you want me, anytime you see me
I don't think you meant to say goodbye
And it's okay, there's always another day.

If you ever find what you were looking for
I will be waiting there, I will be there

And do you ever want me, do you ever need me?
I know that you left before goodbye.
And it's okay, there's always another day.
And anytime you want me, anytime you see me
I don't think you meant to say goodbye
But it's okay, there's always another day.---Lyrics submitted by holly lolly.
