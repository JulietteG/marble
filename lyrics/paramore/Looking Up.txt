Things are looking up, oh finally! 
I thought I'd never see the day when you smile at me.
We always pull through
Oh when we try, 
I'm always wrong but you're never right.
Oh you're never right! 

Honestly, can you believe we crossed the world while it's asleep?
I'd never trade it in, cuz I've always wanted this! 
It's not a dream anymore! Ohhh... 
It's not a dream anymore! It's worth fighting for.

Could have given up so easily
I was a few cheap shots away from the end of me
Taken for granted, almost everything that I would have died for
Just yesterday, 
Just yesterday

Honestly, can you believe we crossed the world while it's asleep?
I'd never trade it in, cuz I've always wanted this! 
It's not a dream anymore! Ohhh... 
It's not a dream anymore! It's worth fighting for.

God knows the world doesn't need another band, (whoo-oa, whooo-oa! )
But what a waste it would've been! (whoo-oa, whooo-oa! )
I can't believe we almost hung it up (whoo-oa, whooo-oa! )
We're just getting started (whoo-oa, whooo-oa! )

Honestly, can you believe we crossed the world while it's asleep?
I'd never trade it in, cuz I've always wanted this! 
It's not a dream anymore! Ohhh... 
It's not a dream anymore! It's worth fighting for.---Lyrics submitted by Felicia.
