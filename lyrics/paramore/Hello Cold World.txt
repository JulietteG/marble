I feel happy, I feel sad, I feel like runnin' through the walls
I'm overjoyed, I'm undecided, I don't know who I am
Well, maybe I'm not perfect
At least I'm workin' on it
22 is, like, the worst idea that I have ever had
It's too much pain, it's too much freedom
What should I do with this?
It's not the way you planned it
It's how you make it happen
Yeah, it's how you make it happen

It's such a cold, cold world (hello cold world)
And I can't get out 
So I'll just make the best, of everything I'll never have
It's such a cold, cold world (hello cold world)
And it's got me down
But I'll get right back up, as long as it spins around
Hello cold world
Oh, oh, oh

Girls and boys keep lining up to see if they can measure up
Well, they look good, and they feel wild, but it will never be enough
You say you're really hurting, at least you're feeling something
We can hope and we can pray that everything will work out fine
But you can't just stay down on your knees, the revolution is outside
You wanna make a difference?
Get out and go begin it
Whoa, get out and go begin it

It's such a cold, cold world (hello cold world)
And I can't get out 
So I'll just make the best, of everything I'll never have
It's such a cold, cold world (hello cold world)
And it's got me down
But I'll get right back up, as long as it spins around
Hello cold world

Oh, oh
Don't need my eyes open wide (oh, oh)
I just wanna feel something

It's such a cold, cold world (hello cold world)
And I can't get out 
So I'll just make the best, of everything I'll never have
It's such a cold, cold world (hello cold world)
And it's got me down
But I'll get right back up, as long as it spins around, spins around
Oh,oh
Hello cold world
Ah,oh
Hello cold world---Lyrics submitted by Jane Deer.
