I'm not angry anymore
Well, sometimes I am
I don't think badly of you
Well, sometimes I do

It depends on the day
The extend of all my worthless rage
I'm not angry anymore

I'm not bitter anymore
I'm syrupy sweet
I rot your teeth down to the core
If I'm really happy

It depends on the day
If I wake up in a giddy haze
Well I'm not angry
I'm not totally angry
I'm not all that angry anymore---
