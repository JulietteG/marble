And when it rains 
on this side of town it touches everything
Just say it again and mean it
We don't miss a thing 

You made yourself a bed at the bottom of the
blackest hole (blackest hole)
And convinced yourself that it's not the reason you don't
see the sun anymore

And no, oh
How could you do it?
Oh, I, I never saw it coming 
No, oh
I need an ending
So why can't you stay
just long enough to explain?

And when it rains,
you always find an escape
Just running away
from all of the ones who love you
From everything

You made yourself a bed at the bottom of the
blackest hole (blackest hole)
And you'll sleep til May.
You'll say that you don't wanna see 
the sun anymore.

And no, oh
How could you do it?
Oh, I, I never saw it coming 
No, oh
I need an ending
So why can't you stay
just long enough to explain?

(Explain your side, take my side)
Take these chances to turn it around
Let's take these chances, we'll make it somehow
And take these chances to turn it around
Just turn it around

No, how could you do it?
Oh, I, I never saw it coming

No, oh
How could you do it?
Oh, I, I never saw it coming 

No, oh
How could you do it?
Oh, I, I never saw it coming 

No, oh
I need an ending 
So why can't you stay 
just long enough to explain?

You can take your time, take my time---Lyrics submitted by KC de Casro.
