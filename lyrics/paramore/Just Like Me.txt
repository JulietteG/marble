I slipped down the stairs,
Tripped over your fragile ego,
I slid down the hallway,
Right into the web you'd woven,

And you never said,
That you meant to save someone,
Somebody just like me,
And you never told me,
You wanted to love someone,
Somebody just like me

You locked all the doors,
You felt it was safer that way,
You put up a wall,
And now your whole world is caving in

And you never said,
That you meant to save someone,
Somebody just like me,
And you never told me,
You wanted to love someone,
Somebody just like me

You swallow your pride as,
You left behind,
Counting stars to name your lies,
You let the rain,
Push you away,
And now you're drowning in the waves

Yeah,
And you never said,
That you meant to save someone,
Somebody just like me,
And you never told me,
You wanted to love someone,
Somebody just like me

And you never told me,
You wanted to love someone,
Somebody just like,
Somebody just like me,
And you never said,
That you meant to save someone,
Like me
Somebody just like me---Lyrics submitted by holly lolly.
