Don't try to take this from me
Don't try to take this from me
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow

Don't try to take this from me
Don't try to take this from me
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow

Feels like I'm waken from the dead
And everyone's been waitin' on me
'Least now I'll never have to wonder
What it's like to sleep a year away
But were we indestructible
I thought that we could brave it all (all)
I never thought that what would take me out
Was hiding down below

Lost the battle, win the war
I'm bringing my sinking ship back to the shore
We're starting over, or head back in
There's a time and a place to die but this ain't it

If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow

Don't try to take this from me
Don't try to take this from me
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow

Don't try to take this from me
Don't try to take this from me
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow

Wish I could find a crystal ball
For the days I feel completely worthless
You know I'd use it all for good
I would not take it for granted (granted)
Instead, I'd have some memories
For the days I don't feel anything
At least, they would remind me
Not to make the same mistakes again

Lost the battle, win the war
I'm bringing my sinking ship back to the shore
We're starting over or head back in
There's a time and a place to die but this ain't it

If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow

There's a time and a place to die

There's a time and a place to die
And this ain't it

There's a time and a place to die
And this ain't it, this ain't it
This ain't it

There's a time and a place to die
There's a time and a place to die
But this ain't it, no

If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
If there's a future, we want it now
(Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow)

If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow---
