It's really hard, I can't cry in your arms
'Cause you're not here
It's not your fault and if it was I wouldn't care
My heart is bigger than the distance in-between us
I know it 'cause I feel it beating
So strong and I'll knock you down
So strong, so strong

Over here
You can count the miles away from where I wanna be
About to skin his woman and she's smiling
Yea, that's what I always loved the most about you
You're so strong, come and knock me down

Baby if I'm half the man I say I am
If I'm a woman with no feel just like I claim I am
Then I believe in what you say, there's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you

I'll get in my car
Driving faster than I ever did before
I won't rest until I finally reach the shore
And then I'll swim back to wherever you are
And we'll ride beyond of coming down to the floor

Making friends with all the unfamiliar pictures
Push it back, I'll be your necessary pleasure
Come up for air just so you know we won't drown
You're so strong, then why can't you cross out hey

Baby if I'm half the man I say I am
If I'm a woman with no feel just like I claim I am
Then I believe in what you say, there's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you

So do you love me?
All you gotta do is say yes
Now do you love me?
And I won't ever second guess
Now do you love me?
All you gotta do is say yes
Now do you love me?
Then you already proved it

Baby if I'm half the man I say I am
If I'm a woman with no feel just like I claim I am
Then I believe in what you say, there's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is

Baby if I'm half the man I say I am
If I'm a woman with no feel just like I claim I am
Then I believe in what you say, there's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you---
