I used to be so quick, so clever
I used to know myself much better
Anyone can see that this is only permanent
Temporary, it never hurts to try

And it's all a game
I know we'll stay the same
But repetition ends in failure
And every time I see it in your eyes
When repetition ends, we'll start over

Now I'm a walking contradiction
So tell me what's wrong with this picture
Cause anyone can see that this is only permanent
Temporary, so don't hurt me this time

And it's all a game
I know we'll stay the same
But repetition ends in failure
And every time I see it in your eyes
When repetition ends, we'll start over

So give it up, just give up
Give it up, give up
So give it up, just give up
Give it up, give up

And it's all a game
I know we'll stay the same
But repetition ends in failure
And every time I see it in your eyes
When repetition ends, we'll start over

We'll start over---Lyrics submitted by holly lolly.
