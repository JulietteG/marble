I heard you driving in my car 
Then in a frozen bar
And I claimed I didn't care for you
But your verse got trapped inside my head
Over and over again
You played yourself to death in me

I thought I'd drop you easily
But that was not to be
You burrowed like a summer tic
So you invade my sleep and confuse my dreams
Turn my nights to sleepless itch

Stuck on you 'till the end of time
I'm too tired to fight your rhyme
Stuck on you 'till the end of time
you've got me paralyzed

Holding on the telephone
I hear your midrange moan
You're everywhere inside my room
Even when I'm alone I hear your mellow drone
You're everywhere inside of me

Stuck on you 'till the end of time
I'm too tired to fight your rhyme
Stuck on you 'till the end of time
You got me trapped inside

I can't escape your incessant whine
When you beam it out all across the sky
No I can't escape
(stuck on you 'till the end of time)
your insipid rhyme
(I'm too tired to fight your rhyme)
When you shoot it deep
(stuck on you 'till the end of time)
Straight into my mind---Lyrics submitted by holly lolly.
