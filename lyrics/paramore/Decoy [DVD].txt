Close your eyes and make believe this is where you want to be
Forgetting all the memories, try to forget love cause love's forgotten me
Well hey, hey baby, it's never too late pretty soon you won't remember a thing
And I'll be distant, the stars reminiscing
Your heart's been wasted on me

Ohhhhh ohh ah oh oh oh oh

You've never been so used as I'm using you, abusing you
My little decoy
Don't look so blue, you should've seen right through
I'm using you, my little decoy
My little decoy

Live your life inside a dream
Time is changing everything
Forgetting all the memories
And I'm forced into to you just cause you're into me
Well hey, hey baby, it's never too late
When I'm gone you won't remember a thing
But I can't stay and you know I won't wait
I was gone from the very first day

Ohhhhh ohh ah oh oh oh oh

You've never been so used as I'm using you, abusing you
My little decoy
Don't look so blue, you should've seen right through
I'm using you, my little decoy

I'm not sorry at all
Oh, no (Not sorry, oh, not sorry)no
I won't be sorry at all
Oh, no (Not sorry, oh, not sorry)no
I'd do it over again

Don't look so blue, my little decoy
You should've seen right through, my little decoy
You've never been so used, my little decoy
As I'm using you, my little decoy---Lyrics submitted by aimee.
