What a shame
We all became such fragile, broken things
A memory remains just a tiny spark

I give it all my oxygen
When they try to take us down
This is what will be, oh glory

Somewhere weakness is our strength
And i'll die searching for it
I can't let myself regret, such selfishess

My pain and all the trouble caused
No matter how long
I believe there's hope

Buried beneath it all and
Hiding beneth it all and
Growing beneath t all and

This is how we'll dance when
When they try to take us down
This is what will be, oh glory

Reaching as I sink down into light
Reaching as I sink down into light

This is how we dance when
When they try to take us down
This is how we sing, oh

This is how we stand when
When they burn our houses down
This is what will be, oh glory---Lyrics submitted by miley.
