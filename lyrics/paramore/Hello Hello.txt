Hello Hello 
is anyone home
Hello Hello 
just pick up the phone

I opened up my life to you
i told you everything i knew
you listened so close they did too
you listened so close when love was just a way out
but your going deaf now
yeah you turned your head around

hello hello
is anyone home
hello hello
just pick up the phone
youll be sorry to hear that im doing fine now
sorry to hear your without me now

you blew up the world i built for us
destroyed our secret universe
threw out the trust i put in you
making me feel like i'd been used
and now i am reminded that i was just blinded

hello hello
is anyone home
hello hello 
just pick up the phone 
you'll be sorry to hear that im doing fine now
sorry to hear your without me now

I'm doing fine
you'll be alright
maybe you'll think of me tonight
you're doing fine
i'll be alright
just give me time 

hello hello 
is anyone home 
hello hello 
just pick up the phone
i dont want to hear youre doing fine now
i dont want to hear im without you now

im without you now 
im without you now
im without you now---Lyrics submitted by Anthony Chanman.
