I told 'em all to stick it
I left town with a dime to my name
I said, I'm done with all of my fake friends
Self-righteous pawns in a losing game

Got my band and a light that won't go out
Been burning since the day I was born
So I cried just a little then I'll dry my eyes
Cause I'm not a little girl no more

Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind

Stand in line for so long just to picket
Something I will never understand
Aren't you tried of always being mad at the world?
Won't you just admit you don't care

And baby, I don't want your pity
So don't feel sad for me
I got a love I would die for and a song to sing
Maybe we're both just living out our dream

Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind

We get along for the most part
Me and reality, it's a light in the dark
We live alone, two different world
Me in a fantasy, you in your memories
But we get along

We get along
(For the most part)
We get along
(For the most part)
We get along
(For the most part)
We get along
(For the most part)

We get along
We get along

Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind (leave you behind)
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind (leave you behind)

Some of us have to grow up sometimes (we grow up and evolve)
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
Some of us have to grow up sometimes (we grow up and evolve)
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind---Lyrics submitted by Clara Hohenberg.
