How can I decide whats right?
When youre clouding up my mind 
I cant win your losing fight 
All the time

Nor could I ever own what's mine 
When youre always taking sides 
But you wont take away my pride 
No, not this time 
Not this time

How did we get here 
When I used to know you so well? 
How did we get here? 
Well, I think I know

The truth is hiding in your eyes 
And its hanging on your tongue 
Just boiling in my blood 
But you think that I cant see

What kind of man that you are 
If youre a man at all 
Well, I will figure this one out 
On my own

(I'm screaming, I love you so) 
On my own 
(But my thoughts you can't decode)

How did we get here? 
When I used to know you so well? 
How did we get here? 
Well, I think I know

Do you see what weve done? 
Were gonna make such fools of ourselves 
Do you see what weve done? 
Were gonna make such fools of ourselves

How did we get here 
When I used to know you so well? 
How did we get here 
When I used to know you so well?

I think I know I think I know 
There is something 
I see in you It might kill me, 
I want it to be true---Lyrics submitted by Lukas Heitkamp.
