Think of me when you're out, when you're out there.
I'll beg you nice from my knees.
And when the world treats you way too fairly.
Well it's a shame I'm a dream.

All I wanted was you.
All I wanted was you.

I think I'll pace my apartment a few times. 
And fall asleep on the couch.
And wake up early to black and white re-runs.
That escape from my mouth.
(Uhoh Uhoh)

All I wanted was you!
All I wanted was you!
All I wanted was you!
All I wanted was you!

I could follow you to the beginning.
Just to re-live the start.
And maybe then we'll remember to slow down.
All of our favorite parts.

All I wanted was you!
All I wanted was you!
All I wanted was you!
All I wanted was you!
All I wanted was you!---Lyrics submitted by Nadira.
