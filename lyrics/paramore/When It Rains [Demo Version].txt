And when it rains 
On this side of town it touches everything
Just say it again and mean it
We don't miss a thing
You made yourself a bed 
At the bottom of the blackest hole (Blackest hole)
and convinced yourself
that it's not the reason you don't see the sun anymore

And no, oh, how could you do it
Oh I, I never saw it coming
No oh, I need an ending
So why can't you stay,
Just long enough to explain?

And when it rains
You always find an escape
Just running away
From all of the ones who love you
From everything
You made yourself a bed at the bottom
Of the blackest hole (blackest hole)
And you'll sleep till May
You'll say that you don't want to see the sun anymore

And no, oh, how could you do it?
Oh I, I never saw it coming
No oh, I need an ending
So why can't you stay
Just long enough to explain?

(Explain your side, Take my time)
Take these chances to turn it around
Just take these chances we'll make it somehow
And Take these chances and turn it around
Just turn it around

And oh, how could you do it?
Oh I, I never saw it coming
No oh, how could you do it?
Oh I, I never saw it coming
No oh, how could you do it?
Oh I, I never saw it coming and
No oh, I need an ending,
So why can't you stay
Just long enough to explain?

You can take your time, take my time---Lyrics submitted by Karina.
