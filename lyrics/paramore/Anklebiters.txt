Why do you care what people think?

Are you hooked up to the leash
You know, anklebiters
Ate up your personality

Try to remember how it felt
You just make up your own sex
And the anklebiters
Chew up, spit out someone else

You fall in love with yourself
Because

Someday you're gonna be the only one you've got
Someday you're gonna be the only one you've got
Why you want a piece of what I need?
Just stop to drop dead
Someday you're gonna be the only one you've got

What do you actually expect?
A broken mirror to reflect, you know, anklebiters
Gave you a false perception

And why do I defend your ignorance
And why do I defend the state you're in, you should
Fall in love with yourself
All again
You fall in love with yourself
Because

Someday you're gonna be the only one you've got
Someday you're gonna be the only one you've got
Why you want a piece of what I need?
Just stop to drop dead
Someday you're gonna be the only one you've got

Anklebiters
Anklebiters
Someday you're gonna be alone
Anklebiters
Anklebiters---
