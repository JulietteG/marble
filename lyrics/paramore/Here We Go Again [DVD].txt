And here we go again
With all the things we said
And not a minute spent
To think that we'd regret
So we just take it back,
These words and hold our breath
Forget the things we swore we meant

I'll write you just to let you know that I'm alright
Can't say I'm sad to see you go
Cause I'm not. (No, I'm not)
Well, I'm not.

And here we go again
With all the things we did
And now I'm wondering
Just who would I have been
To be the one attached
At all times to your hip?
Forget the things we swore we meant.

I'll write you just to let you know that I'm alright
Can't say I'm sad to see you go
Cause I'm not. (No, I'm not)
Well, I'm not. (No, I'm not)
Oh (No, I'm not)

I'll write you to, to let you know that I'm alright
Can't say I'm sad to see you go
Cause I'm not. (No, I'm not)
Well, I'm not. (No, I'm not)
I'm not, I'm not.

And here we go again
With all the things we said
And not a minute spent
To think that we'd regret
So we just take it back...
So we just take it back...
(No, I'm not)
So we just take it back...
(I'm not)
So we just take it back... [8x]---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
