Slipping down a slide
I did enjoy the ride
Don't know what to decide
You lied to me
You looked me in the eye
It took me by surprise
Now are you gratified
You cried to me

La, la, la, la, la

[Chorus:]
Don't turn around
I'm sick and I'm tired of you face
Don't make this worse
You've already gone and got me mad
It's too bad I'm not sad
It's casting over
It's just one of those things
You'll have to get over it

When I was feeling down
You'd start to hang around
And then I found your hands all over me
And that was out of bounds
You filthy rotten hound
It's badder than it sounds, believe me

La, la, la, la, la

[Chorus]

Hey yeah, you gotta get over it
Hey yeah, you gotta get over it

It's too bad I'm not sad
It's casting over
It's just one of those things
You'll have to get over it

Don't turn around
I'm sick and I'm tired of you face
Don't make this worse
You've already gone and got me mad

[Chorus]

You'll have to get over it---Lyrics submitted by kaleigh.
