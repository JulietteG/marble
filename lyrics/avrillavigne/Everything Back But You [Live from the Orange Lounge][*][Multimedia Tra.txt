today was the wrost day i went through hell
i wish i could remove it from my mind
two months away from you but i couldn't tell 
i thought that everything was gonna be just fine  
[chorus]
the postcard that you wrote 
with a stupid little note 
something wasn't quit right about it 
it smelt like cheap perfume 
and it didn't smell like you 
there is no way you could get around it 
because you wrote i wish you were her 
you left out the e 
you left without me 
and now you're somewhere out there with a 
hey hey psycho babe 
i hate you why you why are guys so lame 
everything i gave you 
i want everything back but you
my friends tried to tell me all along
that you wern't the right one for me
my friends tried to tell me to be strong
i bet you didn't think that i would see

[chorus] 2x

i wish you were her 
you left out the e 
you left without me
everything i gave you i want everyhing back but you2x---Lyrics submitted by kayci.
