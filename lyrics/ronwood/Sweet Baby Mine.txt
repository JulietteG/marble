There's a sweet memory, that I keep in my mind
And sometimes i drift,way back in time
To the day i first held you, and kissed your sweet face
Now these precious memories,time can't erase

Sweet baby mine, where have you gone
Now when i look at you, will i see a man
And you've grown proud and tall, with the passing of time
Still in my heart you'll always be, sweet baby mine

You may travel the world, search for fortune and fame
Don't give up till you've made your mark
And everyone knows your name
But remember when you are gone, many miles far away
That the love in your mother's heart, always will stay

Sweet baby mine, where have you gone
Now when i look at you,will i see a man
And you've grown proud and tall, with the passing of time
Still in my heart, you'll always be, sweet baby mine

Interlude

There's a sweet memory, that i keep in my mind
Sometimes I drift, way back in time
To the day i first held you, and kissed your sweet face
Now these precious memories, time can't erase

Sweet baby mine, where have you gone
Now when i look at you, will i see a man
And you've grown proud and tall, with the passing of time
Still in my heart,you'll always be, sweet baby mine
Still in my heart, you'll always be, sweet baby mine.---Lyrics submitted by Meta.
