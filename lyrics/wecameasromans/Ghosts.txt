Bad habits are ghosts haunting me
A thought that never leaves
from when I wake until I sleep
to seek haven in my dreams
where I feel I can finally breathe
Forgot everything
away from my reality
Because as long as I stay here
I won't face my fears
Right now I fear myself
and what my heart held
The worst words or warmest heart
Self-serving or selfless love
I will scream til the breath is gone from my lungs
I will scream til it's gone
I will leave all the rest of my ghosts behind
I will leave them behind
Ghosts haunting me
aren't defining me
Ghosts taunting me
are reminding me
Change the way you act, not just the way you think
Change the way you live, live the way you claim
Words are just words, until they're put to work
and it will be actions, not words, that change this earth
Change the way you act, change the way you live
Change the way you act, not just the way you think
Change the way you live, live by the words you say
I will scream til the breath is gone from my lungs
I will scream til it's gone
I will leave all the rest of my ghosts behind
I will leave them behind
Change the way you act, not just the way you think
Change the way you live, live the way you claim
Words are just words, until they're put to work
and it will be actions, not words, that change this earth---Lyrics submitted by Shaun Newman.
