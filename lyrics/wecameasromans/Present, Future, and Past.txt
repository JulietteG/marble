Try to destroy me
I am a soldier
I am a riot
I am the new age
I am the liar
I am an idea
I am steadfast
I am present, future and past!

Like a forest burning
Time is running out
And the tides keep turning
I am here, I am now

Like a wave thats breaking
I will take you out
Try to destroy me, try to destroy me

Go!

Try to destroy me!

As much as you hold me, I will escape
Everything that you told me, I will change
Dont think you can rule me, I am a rock
Your words cant control me, Its only just struck

Like a forest burning
Time is running out
And the tides keep turning
I am here, I am now

You are a jokester
You arent dying
Bring out the old days
The flames are rising
A burning empire
Is all I need
There is no truth in a fire
Burn so passionate

Tear me up
Dont make a difference at all
Take me down
Dont make a difference at all
Tear me up
(Dont make a difference)

Like a forest burning
Time is running out
And the tide keeps turning
I am here, I am now

Like a wave thats breaking
I will take you out
Try to destroy me
Try to destroy me

I am a soldier
I am a riot
I am the new age
I am the liar
I am an idea
I am steadfast
I am present, future and past!

Try to destroy me (Try to destroy me)
Try to destroy me (Try to destroy me)
Try to destroy me (Try to destroy me)
Try to destroy me!---Lyrics submitted by Shaun Newman.
