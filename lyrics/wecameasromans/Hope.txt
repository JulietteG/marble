Yeah

Sometimes I feel so wrong 
Like I'm being held down 
I feel my heart like a rock, it's sinking 
These days can get so dark 
Like an eclipse in the sky 
But I can rise above 
I can find my way

I can run
I can change all the answers
Or what I'll hope they'll be

I won't stop
I won't let my own questions
Fade away in my dreams

Don't fade away
We won't fall to our knees
We are the one true hope
So give me an answer
Are you in or you out
We are the one true hope
So give me an answer

We all fall
Crawl out of the fear you're in
Don't give up
We won't fall to our knees
We are the one true hope
So give me an answer
Woah Woah
So give me an answer, now
Woah Woah
Give me an answer

Stand up
You have a voice to be heard
Your worth more than words
So let your fire burn
Oh, your flame will be lit
Again when a candle is burned at both ends
And there's nothing left

You can change
You can become selfless
Your not set in stone

You will wade through mistakes that we all make
But just hold on

Don't fade away (Hold on)
We won't fall to our knees
We are the one true hope
So give me an answer
Are you in or you out
We are the one true hope
So give me an answer

We all fall
Crawl out of the fear you're in
Don't give up
We won't fall to our knees
We are the one true hope
So give me an answer

We are the one true hope (Woah)
So are you with me (Woah)
Or will you fall to your knees (Woah)

We are the one true hope (Woah)
So are you with me (Woah)
Or will you fall to your knees (Woah)

We are the one true hope
We are the one true hope

We won't fall to our knees
We are the one true hope
So give me an answer
Are you in or you out
We are the one true hope
So give me an answer

We all fall
Crawl out of the fear you're in
Don't give up
We won't fall to our knees
We are the one true hope
So give me an answer
Woah Woah
Give me an answer, now
Woah Woah
Give me an answer---Lyrics submitted by Abby Hagan.
