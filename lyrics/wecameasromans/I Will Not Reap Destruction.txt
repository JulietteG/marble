Mindless.
This mindless flesh that devours,
it keeps me bound at the bottom.
And to live in this flesh
will keep me bound by myself.

Hollowed out your heart to live this way.
Was it that hard to let love fade?
Lashing out, yet reserved.
The mindless are easily lured
in pain and perverse.

Lured to this dream alluring to the skies
to live among them and to never die, never die.
The mindless are easily lured.
The mindless are easily lured.

Lured to this dream alluring to the skies
To live among them and to never die, never die, never die.
To be worth more, though we are made the same.
To attain love by rule rather than by choice.

Mindless.
This mindless flesh that devours,
it keeps me bound at the bottom.
And to live in this flesh
will keep me bound by myself.

So fill your heart to live in love,
lock arms with your brothers,
break the binds of this flesh.
This mindless flesh that devours.
This mindless flesh

Let us not become conceited.
I will not reap destruction
but life instead.

Lured to this dream alluring to the skies
To live among them and to never die, never die, never die
To be worth more, though we are made the same.
To attain love by rule rather than by choice.---Lyrics submitted by Evelyn.
