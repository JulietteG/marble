Razor and blade
Cut the same old way
Same old cut.
Same old day.

Work it on out

Changed the locks
On all the same doors
Holes in the ceilings
Nails on the floor
What i want it for?

Work it on out

(Adlib Vamp)

Explanation
No justification
Consternation
Lack of pure reason
Dancer in the night
Do you feel all right?
How you gonna dance
Dancing on steel
In glass high heels? ---
