Jenny was my best friend, went away one summer
came back with a secret she just couldn't keep
A child inside her 
was just too much for her 
so she cried herself to sleep 
And she made a decision some find hard to accept
too young to know that one day she might live to regret.

Chorus:
But I would die for that, just to have one chance
to hold in my hands, all that she had-(2x time:, "they" had)
I would die - for that

I've been givin' so much to the husband that I love
so why do I feel incomplete?
With every test and checkup 
we're told not to give up
he wonders if it's him
& I wonder if it's me
all I want is a family
like everyone else I see
& I won't understand it, if it's not ment to be

(repeat chorus)

And I wanna know what it's like
to bring a dream to life
for that kinda love, what I'd give up-
I would die for that.

Sometimes it's hard to conceive
with all that I got, all I achieve
what I want most before my time is gone
is to hear the words, "I love you, mom."

I would die for that
just to have one chance
to hold in my hands, what so many have
I would die for that

And I wanna know what it's like
to bring a dream to life
How I would love, what some give up 
I would die
I would die.........for that.---Lyrics submitted by lyrissa.
