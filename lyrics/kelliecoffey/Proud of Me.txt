Do you know, you have this power over me
somtimes you win and when you do
later I'm shattered
Seeking approval and I'm hangin' on to every word 
'cause your word is gold and I wanna shine
what you think matters

chrous:
I know that you love me I've always known that
I know that you'd give me the shirt off your back
you always give me the best I could have
but to know that you're proud of me,
is all I ever wanted
is all I ever wanted

when I was a young girl, so many dreams you had for me
some lived & died, some were realized, 
and I had my whole life to rain though,
Now that I'm older, do you like what I've become?
What do you see when you at me?
am I still your angel?

(chorus)

Do you know- you have this power over me?
