Late at night I try to sleep
But across my skin it creeps
As the hairs upon my neck begin to rise

Theres a whisper in my ear
Soft and faint but I still hear
Back to sleep I beg you close your weary eyes

In a cold sweat I could hear these words
From a voice that curled my toes
And I know what you must think of me
But I dont believe in ghosts

Like a shot I bolt from bed
And I try to clear my head
Try to shake the sleep awake I say whos there

Im an echo from before
Just an echo nothing more
Now go back to bed and sleep without a care

In a cold sweat I could hear these words
From a voice that curled my toes
And I know what you must think of me
But I dont believe in ghosts

In a cold sweat I could hear these words
From a voice that curled my toes
And I know what you must think of me
But I dont believe in ghosts
No I dont believe in ghosts
No I dont believe in ghosts
No I dont believe in ghosts---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
