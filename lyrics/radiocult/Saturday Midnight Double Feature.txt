By the pale moon's light I hurry home
Knowing what's in store
By the television's glow I sit and wait
Longing for one more

One more night of thrilling chills
Like a dozen times before
One more night of chilling thrills
Like they just don't make anymore

It's the Saturday midnight double feature
Late night horror show
It's the Saturday midnight double feature
Filled with creatures that'll make you hurry home

From black lagoons and distant moons
Strange creatures fill the screen
In black and white it's such a fright
Like nothing that you've seen

One more night of thrilling chills
Like a dozen times before
One more night of chilling thrills
Like they just don't make anymore

It's the Saturday midnight double feature
Late night horror show
It's the Saturday midnight double feature
Filled with creatures that'll make you hurry home

It's the Saturday midnight double feature
Late night horror show
It's the Saturday midnight double feature
Filled with creatures that'll make you hurry

Saturday midnight double feature
Late night horror show
It's the Saturday midnight double feature
Filled with creatures that'll make you hurry home---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
