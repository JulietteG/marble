Am I strong enough
To show a little tenderness
I've been here long enough 
To know just what I missed
I've been waiting all night
Just to see what the sun's gonna bring me
I try to play it cool
But my smile might just betray me

I Feel Good
So Good
When I'm with you
When I'm with you

Are you ready 
To feel a little Rock & Roll
Just keep it steady
It'll be good for your soul
So just close your eyes 
And let the world melt all around you
It should be no surprise 
That I'm oh, so glad I found you

I Feel Good
So Good
When I'm with you
When I'm with you

Don't wanna open my eyes 
And wake up alone again
I'll keep 'em shut 
And wait till you're here and then
Together we'll stay 
And see what lies ahead
Or stay in bed 
And keep on dreamin' away

Are you ready 
To feel a little Rock & Roll
Just keep it steady
It'll be good for your soul
So just close your eyes 
And let the world melt all around you
It should be no surprise 
That I'm oh, so glad I found you

I Feel Good
So Good
When I'm with you
When I'm with you

I Feel Good
So Good
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
When I'm with you---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
