He was alive
He was ticking like a bomb
He was living a lie
He said come on come on come on

Stare at the clay 
As it cracks in the ground
Unearth the madness 
Of the newly unbound
She said

Shoot the dead

Planted like a seed
That was never meant to grow
The devils weeds
Creeping through the smoke

The gun was shaking
Sweat bled through his hands
His mind was racing
Was this really what theyd planned?
She said

Shoot the dead

His breath was forced
Fear had made him pale
The moonlights glow was dim
He prayed he wouldn't fail

His heart was pounding
Like the rhythm of a drum
His mind was racing
Did they know what theyd become?
She said

Shoot the dead
Shoot the dead
Shoot the dead
Shoot the dead

Shoot the dead---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.
