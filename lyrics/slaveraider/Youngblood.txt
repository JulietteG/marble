Sweet sixteen and never been kissed
That kinda girl doesn't even exist
Fresh fruit ripe for pickin
Sometimes I just can't resist them.
(Can't resist the temptations of........

Youngblood young lover
Youngblood don't want no other
Youngblood hot lover
Youngblood don't need another

Eight to eighty crippled or crazy or so I use to say
Then young blood came drove me insane
Now I've got youngblood in my vein
(Time for another transfusion)

Chorus

Baby have I got a deal for you
I'm prepared to make an offer too good to be true
Cuz I'm a man baby theres no doubt
Gonna make you scream gonna make you shout

Sweet sixteen and never been kissed
She's a girl the little girl that kind of girl I can't resist
I got to have youngblood watch and every night
I can see your mouth water baby come and take a bite
(Take a bite of this)

Chorus
