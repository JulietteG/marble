Leavin tonight westward bound
I've got a date with disaster
Me and the gang are gonna raid this town

Millions of people every day
Pack their bags on their way to the

Sin city social

A town of chance, crime romance
Whatever you desire
The sin city social's not a high school dance, its the flame of fire

Feel the heat jump right in
Welcome one and all to the city of sin.

Sin city social

Ladies of the night gamblers delight
Sin city socialites
Lord have pity on this city
Lord have pity on sin city
