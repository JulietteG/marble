I walk into the room all eyes upon me
Everybody wonders wonders what this boys gonna do
I'm gonna blow your mind and tell you what to do
Gonna get you so rowdy you'll never be blue

Chorus
I'm a bad boy gonna make you feel good
I'm the life of the party
The head of the cool
I'm the high priest of good times and fun

I got a piss poor attitude about workin
A nine to five job, that never would do
I started rockin and rollin now I'm controlling
Lots of crazy people just like me and you

Chorus
