Tonight theres gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in this town
See me and the boys we don't like it
We're getting up and going down

Hidin low lookin right to left
If you see us coming I think its best
To move away do you hear what I say
From under my breath.

Tonight theres gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in this town
Tonight theres gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in this town
Tonight theres gonna be a jailbreak
So don't you be around

Tonight theres gonna be trouble
Some of us won't survive
See me and the boys mean business
Bustin out dead or alive.

I can heat the hound dogs on my trail
All hell breaks loose alarms and sirens wail
Like the game
If you loose
Go to jail

Tonight theres gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in this town
Tonight theres gonna be a jailbreak
So don't you be around
Tonight theres gonna be trouble
I'm gonna find myself in
Tonight theres gonna be trouble
No-ones safe little friend---Lyrics submitted by AJ.
