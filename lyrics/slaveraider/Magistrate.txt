The Magistrate

Before this trial begins, understand that no one walks from my court unscathed, especially someone so obviously guilty of crimes against the state. Standing before us we have the high priest of good times. Hah. good times you'll not have in my court young man.

Accused of playing rock n roll are you? Well I intend on prosecuting you to the fullest extent of the law. Now stand and deliver. What do you know about rock n roll.
