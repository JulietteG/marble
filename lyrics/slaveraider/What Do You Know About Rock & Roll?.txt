Let the court come to order
Let the trial begin
Under the governing laws of the federation
Rock and roll has been banned
Now whats this all about
You stand before us a rock and roller no doubt.

What do you know about rock and roll
What do you know about rock and roll
What do you know about rock and roll
What do you know about rock.

I stand before you guilty as accused
These laws of yours should be abused
Everybody stand up, shout out and cry
Without music we'd rather die.

I see no reason to prolong this trial
You're guilty but before this is final
I'd like to know for myself and the court
What do you know about this rock and roll 
You support?
