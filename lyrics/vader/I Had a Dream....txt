I had a dream
And I was travelling far among the stars
Worlds behind the gate
Where the night is a shield against the light

I had a dream
Land inhabited by the creatures
Killing, destroying, enslaving themselves

I clad my wings
I descended with fire and death
Bringing them fear and pain
Turning their land into my domain

I came spreading disease
I was detaching their flesh from their bones
I killed those who demur
And I was eating their young

I was building thrones and the cities full of filth and disgrace
I designated, precipitated and punished by taking the mind
With the head

I had a dream
Temples, priests, sacrifice
Blood and fire is all what they trust
I gave them the knowledge
Seal by the light of the stars above

Now fever is over
Pain in my eyes
But I remember that night
As I was the God ---Lyrics submitted by anna grace.
