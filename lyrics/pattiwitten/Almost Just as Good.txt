I see your eyes sliding right past mine
feel my heart start sinking
Women always want to know
what a man is thinking

Good intentions line the road
said Id go the distance
Women navigate by landmarks
the path of least resistance

chorus:
Say yes, say uncle, say you like my dress
Say when, say something dont make me guess
If you lie a little bit by acting just as if nothing happened
its so close to the truth
its almost just as good

Skin is coin, familiar tender
times the bed we lie on
Buttons, zippers, fingers, whispers
how we keep the bargain

chorus

Tenderness and anger tangled up
seamless, interlocking
Background music you can talk right over
If you can call this talking

On the skyline crows coming in
speak a secret language
Show me angels, show me for mercy
show me safer passage
