Change can be so subtle, settling like dust
You don't know that you're in trouble 
cuz you haven't changed that much
Call it sentimental, go on shrug it off
Deny what you cant handle
its harder to be soft
When you drive too fast at night
when you lie to make it right
when you break it
you say that you liked it rough

Come on, admit it
You wont admit it
You just dont know when enough is enough

No wonder that youre angry on your side of the door
With a pocket full of pennies 
you cant spend here anymore
Who will see you walk away
Who will free you the same way 
that you left them
you wont get them to open up

Change can be so subtle
settling like dustYou don't know that you're in trouble
cuz you haven't changed that much

Come on, admit it
You wont admit it
You just dont get it
Come on, admit it
You just dont know when enough is enough---Lyrics submitted by patti.
