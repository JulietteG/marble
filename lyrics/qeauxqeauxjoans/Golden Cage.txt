I dont wanna be a fulltime lover, cause expectation leads to frustrations
And I dont want to waste time to recover, from the fight well have, cause all the things we say
Youll be blaming me for not acting who you want me to be, Ill be blaming you
For acting like a fool

Can you let me go
Or will you hold me hostage like a bird in a cage Ill be spending my days
Growin old
And unable to fly, Ill be your private nightingale crying lonely lullabies, dont be surprised when the time comes that I dislike you
For all that you are
I dont want to grown wild and discover the greatest things still left unknown
Oh I, I want to stay undercover, cause I got something to say I got something to show you
Keeping me private or am I gonna end my own life(this line is not perfect yet)
And I reveals too and its all cruelly oh I need to know if you

Can let me go, or will you hold me hostage
Like a bird in a cage Ill be spending my days.
Growin old and unable to fly
Ill be your private nightingale crying lonely lullabies.
Dont be surprised when the time comes
That I dislike you
For all that you are

Lala laaaaaa jayeah
Lala laaaaaa ah yeahiyeahiyeah
Lala laaaaaa jayeah
Oh ooohw

Lala laaaaaa jayeah
Lala laaaaaa yeahiyeahiyeah
Lala laaaaaa hahaaj

Can you let me go
Or will you hold me hostage like a bird in a cage I dont wanna spend my days
Growing old
And unable to fly, I dont wanna be your private nightingale, No I
Wont cry... No
No broking heart is on
Noooo---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
