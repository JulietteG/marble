She had hair like Jeannie Shrimpton
Back in 1965
She had legs that never ended
I was halfway paralyzed

She was tall and cool and pretty
And she dressed as black as coal
If she asked me to, I'd murder
I would gladly lose my soul

Now I lie in bed and think of her
Sometimes I even weep
Then I dream of her
Behind a Wall of Sleep

Well she held a bass guitar
And she was playing in a band
And she stood just like Bill Wyman
Now I am her biggest fan

Now I know I'm one of many
Who would like to be your friend
And I've got to find a way
To let her know I'm not like them

Now I lie in bed and think of her
Sometimes I even weep
Then I dream of her
Behind a Wall of Sleep

(Repeat)

Got your number from a friend of mine
Who lives in your home town
Called you up to have a drink
Your roommate said you weren't around

Now I know I'm one of many
Who would like to be your friend
And I've got to find a way
To let her know I'm not like them

Now I lie in bed and think of her
Sometimes I even weep
Then I dream of her
Behind a Wall of Sleep
(Behind a Wall of Sleep)
