Oh, let me linger by your shore
And let me dream for ever more

Blue river,
Oh blue river.

Although the one I love has flown
And though she left me all alone, 
Forgive her,
Blue river.

Just let your rippling waters flow, 
But keep on searching as you go 
Blue river --

Please hear my plea,
Find her for me.

Then tell my love that Ive been true
And say Im just as blue as you 

Blue river,
Oh blue river.---Lyrics submitted by Julio.
