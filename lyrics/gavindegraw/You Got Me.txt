When the fear takes you down
When the doubt takes you under
When you sink like a stone
And you can't breathe

When the tears take control
When the demons take over
Won't be in this alone
You got me

You got me

When the walls all caved in
When the nights all get colder
When you hang by a thread
Of sanity

Rest your head on my heart
And your pain on my shoulders
Make your way to my arms
'Cause you got me

You got me

I'll be the one to lead you home
I'll be the one to keep you warm
I'll take you way out of the storms
When you can't stand, I'll stand up for you

When the fear takes you down
When the doubt takes you under
You're not in this alone
You got me
You got me
You got me

I'll be the one to lead you home
I'll be the one to keep you warm
I'll take you way out of the storms
When you can't stand, I'll stand up for you---
