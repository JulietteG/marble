[Verse 1]
Melt Antarctica, savin Africa
I failed algebra and I misused some times
Were at war again, save the world again
You can all join in, but you cant smoke inside

[Bridge 1]
You said Take me home, I cant stand this place
Cause theres too many hipsters and I just cant relate
Youre my neon gypsy, my desert rain
Youre my Helter Skelter, oh how can I explain that

[Chorus]
Youre the best I ever had
And Im trying not to get stuck in my head
But I read that soda kills you and Jesus saves
On the bathroom wall where I saw your name
Youre the best I ever had
I wont be the same

[Verse 2]
Night sky full of drones, this neighborhood of clones
Im looking at the crowd and theyre staring at their phones
They groom the coast line here, the sun will disappear (Oh God!)
And maybe once a year, I think theyll clean my car

[Bridge 2]
Caught my reflection, drop the call
Ive been medicated with cigarettes and alcohol
I got vertigo, no I cant see straight
I got obligations though Im usually late but

[Chorus]
Youre the best I ever had
And Im trying not to get stuck in my head
But I think I dropped my wallet in Santa Fe
Lost the only picture I had of you that day and
Youre the best I ever had
I wont be the same

[Middle 8]
Hey West Virginia, Hey North Dakota
I think I love you, but dont even know you
Hey Massachusetts, Hey Minnesota
I think I love you, but dont even know you
Hey Carolina, Hey Oklahoma
I think I love you, but dont even know you
Hey Alabama, Hey California
I think I love you, but dont even know you

[Chorus]
Youre the best I ever had (youre the best I ever had)
And Im trying not to get stuck in my head (get stuck in my head)
But I passed the longest sign on the interstate
Saying Find someone before it gets too late
Youre the best I ever had (youre the best I ever had)
I wont be the same

[Middle 8]
Hey West Virginia, Hey North Dakota (Oh why, oh why)
I think I love you, but dont even know you (I wont be the same)
Hey Massachusetts, Hey Minnesota (youre the best I ever had)
I think I love you, but dont even know you (I wont be the same)

Yeah, I wont be the same---
