Whenever i see you i need more
and i want you to stay till the end.
One look at that smile and im all your's
Will you just smile at me again?

I have you to thank for making me 
so,so hard to please because 
you treated me so good that no-one
else could hold your makeup. 
Because of you girl i never wanna break up

The difference i'm feeling in my hearth 
is the difference of loving or not.
And under the stars and moon and sun
is the perfect becoming of one.

I have you to thank for making me 
so,so hard to please because 
you treated me so good that no-one
else could hold your makeup. 
Because of you girl i never wanna break up

If i told you that your love i can ace
then id be lying cause i make some mistakes,
but i'm trying with perfect faith.
When i let you in, I began to win,
and now im just all gold.
After all i've done, and the road I run.

I wanna thank you, i wanna thank you.

I have you to thank for making me 
so,so hard to please because 
you treated me so good that no-one
else could hold your makeup. 
Because of you girl i never wanna break up

I have you to thank for making me 
so,so hard to please because 
you treated me so good that, no-one
else could hold your makeup

Because of you girl, (be)cause of you girl, 
(be)cause of you girl i never wanna break up

All i can do when i think about you is: 
thank you baby, thank you baby.

All i do when i think about you 
is thank you baby, 
i just wanna thank you baby, 
i just wanna thank you.---Lyrics submitted by Glenn.
