Should've known better than to hear your lies
Should've known you would only make me cry
Should've known you were too good to be true
Should've known I was too good for you

No one ever made me feel this way
I lost myself for you from the very first day
Now I'm left feeling so confused
What am I gonna do

Should I go should I stay I don't know
This is what I asked myself
Call me a fool for loving you
Please tell me

Where do I go from here
Where do I go
Where do I go from here
Where do I go

Tell me how did we end up this way
You've never missed a good thing till it's gone away
I'm sitting here trying to reason with myself
Thought you were here thinking about someone else
Saying you're sorry won't take away the pain
'Cause things will never ever be the same
'Cause I was your everything and you were my everything
And you got my heart you see baby

Should I go should I stay I don't know
This is what I asked myself
Call me a fool for loving you
Baby tell me

Where do I go from here
Where do I go
Where do I go from here
Where do I go

I don't really want to say bye bye
There's so many reasons why
I don't ever wanna lose your love baby
When trust walks right out the door
It makes you so hard to believe you anymore
This shouldn't be
Oh baby tell me

Where do I go from here
Where do I go
Where do I go from here
Where do I go

Where do I go from here
Where do I go
Where do I go from here
Where do I go

Where do I go from here
Where do I go
Where do I go from here
Where do I go---
