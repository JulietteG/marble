Where the ladies
You can feel me

Your brother, your sister

[VERSE 1]
[Young Chris rappin']
I think i might wife her
You know, powder blue rocawear suite
White nikes (uh)
My niggas like her
She been with me through the grind
Girl you put in that time like been liferz
Got tight, use 2 hookey and chill
She tight, plus she cook up a meal
Had the hook up for real
More headaches and stress cuz a child involved
Itz all good cuz our sex be my tylenol
Best baby doll of all
Shit the rest of you childish broads
Give me the sex then i'm tired of yall
So find the next to provide for yall

Plus she bout to drop my baby girl (off)
Forget about all the rumors you hear girl
A newer life is soon to be here girl
And cant nothin fuck up that
Gotta fuck with that
Cant find a better love than that

[CHORUS]

Dont stop givin me your lovin
Cuz my hearts been racin for your lovin

Girl you got me goin crazy
You got me thinkin bout you baby
Could you be my one and only lady
(cuz there's no better love)

[VERSE 2]
[Neef rappin']
Comin up i thought cupid was stupid
Only two loves, my family and music
Fallen through somethin, jus couldnt do it
It was the beginin of time
And you was like nine but god damn you was fine
Use to stay on my mind
When i was out on my grind
Open up the bags when im choppin my dimes
There in the spindell
Stood by me from the windows
Popped up mad shit with me and got me rentals
Sick with the plastic, what can i say
Bitches hat around the way i had a lady, they
Gossipin, watchin him, runnin back
Moved up north, kinda fell of track
Still my peoples though
Love when i see you though
Once a while, might call
Jus to chill, might ball
Forever my dogg
Even when i downfall
First in line whenever chicks is envolved

[CHORUS]
[Rell singing']
Dont stop givin me your lovin
Cuz my hearts been racin for your lovin
I wont give it up for nothin
(cuz there's no better love)
Girl you got me goin crazy
You got me thinkin bout you baby
Could you be my one and only lady
(cuz there's no better love)

Baby i feel the same as Neef do
Spit the game as he do

We got them goin home
We got them all alone
Jus us, nobody's wrong

We do our jobs at the mall

[Rell singin']
Every since the day i saw your face
My mind told me
You were the one that was down (for me)
And baby when i get laced

So dont you let a thing
Turn you away from the love you need (my dear)

Around with you, cuz i know i found lovin right here
