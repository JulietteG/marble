The girl be, cooking and cleaning and cleaning and cooking
She be, constantly douching and cleaning her pussy
And when she, step on the scene everybody be looking
And to, get in them jeans everybody be wishing
But she, only want players who far from rookie
And if you, ain't got the cake
Can't play with the nookie
Her titties sitting pretty and she soft as a cushion
And If you, try to holla she might holla she tooken
And she walk like a bad bitch talk like a bad bitch
And go and get her hair and shit fixed is a habit
Now bad bitch go and buy Finch more than average
And bad bitches get to take trips with the savage
Can never tell a bad bitch a freak she too classy
But shit I can tell from her lips that she nasty
Expensive ass pant-ses grip to them asses
She mean as a pitbull sweet like care-bear

(Chorus)
Now that's a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Now that's a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Now that's a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Now that's a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Girl you a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Girl you a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Girl you a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Girl you a bad bitch (a bad bitch)

[Verse 2]
You want a bad bitch? Trinas the baddest.
and im thick and fine from the cornbread and the cabbage, the savage.
I would give you my number so you could have this but i dont need the
stalking, prank calls, or the madness. My ass like WHOA, my goodies incredible.
I'm in this Cheerleaders skirt, and these legs flexible. You flippin and pushin and pushin
and flippin. You can have an old lady, if i want you i aint trippin. I got, my own money,
own car, own house. I could cook a meal, same time to turn a nigga out. I'm the, example 
of what you want up on your team, but 

(Chorus)
Now that's a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Now that's a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Now that's a bad bitch (a bad bitch)

Girl you a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Girl you a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Girl you a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Girl you a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
