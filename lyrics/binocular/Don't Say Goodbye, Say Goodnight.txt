i lie awake and feel your nearness
i never wanted more than this


i don't want to run beneath your tears
i don't want to catch them when their falling
but its the same old song
playing over and over


refrain:
now i lie upon my face
though we try
i guess that's the way its suppose to be


chorus:
don't say goodbye, say goodnight
so it's not over
and if you try,
and answer why, its just over
its goodbye
hhmmmm...

i hope to see the dawn of daybreak
and the sunrise to cloudy skies
now i try to see the truth
but i close my eyes
and you where there for me
and i was there for you


[repeat chorus]
