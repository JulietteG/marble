Five more minutes then I go on another floor
You are on my mind like never before
Seem away how you fit my heart
That I cant feel you before Ive start

To see in the spotlight and I miss you and not Tokio
And if I was younger I would cry
I seek for a good life but I think of you and not California
And if I was younger I would cry
But tears are running dry

Te hecho de menos mi corazon donde estas
Me puedes prometer que no me olvidaras
Mi vida esta completa mente si tu regresaras cuanto han que es

To see in the spotlight and I miss you and not Tokio
And if I was younger I would cry
I seek for a good life but I think of you and not California
And if I was younger I would cry
But tears are running dry

I dont know how you do
how you can
how youre there
youre obsessing my head
I dont know where you are
its too far
anyway youre obsessing my day
And I wish you were here, I wish you were here, I wish you were here
I dont know how you do
how you can
how youre there
youre obsessing my head

To see in the spotlight and I miss you and not Tokio
And if I was younger I would cry
I seek for a good life but I think of you and not California
And if I was younger I would cry---Lyrics submitted by Marilina.
