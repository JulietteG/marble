You say you want space 
A little time on your own 
To clear out your mind, 
Really unwind, and just be alone 

Things are moving too fast, going too far 
Getting too close, too close to the heart 

And now you want space 
Well I'll give you space 
Plenty of space, all the space that you need 
Does it make you feel free, make you feel young 
How does it feel not to need anyone? 
You say you want space 
Well I'll give you space 

You need your own bed 
You need your own room 
Well how bout an island 
I bet you could find one 
On the dark side of the moon 

Then you wont have to deal with anything real 
Cause I wont be here, I'll just disappear 

And you can have space 
Honey, I'll give you space 
Plenty of space, all the space that you need 
Does it make you feel free, make you feel young 
How does it feel not to need anyone? 
Oh, you say you need space 
Baby, you can have space 
I'll give you space---Lyrics submitted by Jennifer.
