you cant sit up
you fell too fast
you come at the right time
you come too fast
you bloom in spring
you move the sky
youve come in singing
you come in right

you were like a cloud
yes you are a flower
then you were a lime
now our love is sour
you were like a cloud
you were just like a flower
then you were a lime
now our love is sour

dont give up (I owe you)
no dont give up
no dont give up (I owe you)
dont give up

you were like a cloud
yes you were a flower
then you were a lime
now our love is sour
you were like a cloud
you were just like a flower
then you were a lime
now our love is sour

here I feel I wish I could just see it
the love the hate the things that separate
forcing conscious to conscious every small attack
it takes a small man to notice but not to act up
confrontation complication needs a foundation
I'm calm baby, I'm calm

you were like a cloud (You know, I know)
yes you are a flower (Love is all you need)
then you were a lime (You know, I know)
now our love is so sour (Love is all we need)
so sour
so sour
so sour

dont give up
no dont give up
no dont give up
no dont give up
start again buttercup (I owe you)
start again buttercup (I owe you)
start again buttercup (I owe you)
start again, start again dear (I owe you)

When I saw what we had I gave it to everywhere, dear.
When you lost the nurses I found you a doctor, in me, in me..---Lyrics submitted by Rogelio.
