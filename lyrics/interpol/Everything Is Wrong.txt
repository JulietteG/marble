(Truly, truly, truly)

Enter the override, how we run the day
Sleeker and cheaper, the wind changed
Following deeper, they do what I say
Spectral incentives, have paved the way

Everything is wrong, wrong, everything is wrong
I guess we open time, what is now is overcome

(Truly, truly, truly)

I think I know why, I say what I say
Inverse achievements, I rule the daze
Am I more soulful? Am I coming down now?
Can we start over as agents of peace?

Everything is wrong, wrong, everything is wrong
All we have is time, but my heart is going wrong
We're taking a part of both of us, but nobody likes to wait
Everything is wrong, truly wrong, everything is wrong
Everything is wrong

(Truly, truly, truly)

(Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on)

We made our home, without begging a pardon
We made our home, with time alone
It's taking apart the best of us, and nobody likes to wait

Everything is wrong, truly wrong, everything is wrong---
