And she said, love come over
My head, it bows
Oh, the feeling
And she won't hold me again
I made no sound 
Oh, the beating

Then she swore love has never gone so easily
Then we went over again
My head, it bows
Oh, the feeling

She said you don't need time
He'd say, we don't need your maid inside
My faith won't lie

He said you don't need time
He'd say you wanna leave my lady lover
My 18th summer of love

She said you don't read minds
Be patient
You won't leave me shaken
Leave me shaken

I keep falling
Maybe half the time
Maybe half the time

I keep falling
Maybe half the time
Maybe half the time

It's all the rage back home
It's all the rage back home

And she said love come over
My head, it bows
Oh, the feeling

She said you oughta read
You're gonna see my face in lights
My faith don't lie

My sweet you don't need time
Just come away
Just say you love me
Just say you love me

She said you don't read minds
So be patient
You won't leave me shaken
You have been mistaken

I keep falling
Maybe half the time
Maybe half the time

I keep falling
Maybe half the time
Maybe half the time

It's all the rage back home
It's all the rage back home

All the rage back home
All the rage back home

I keep falling
Maybe half the time
Maybe half the time

It's all the rage back home
All the rage back home
All the rage back home

Falling
Maybe half the time
Maybe half the time

It's all the rage back home
All the rage back home
All the rage back home
All the rage back home---
