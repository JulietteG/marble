Come back, come back, I'm the warning
Come back, come back, breaker one (come back, come back, breaker one)
Come back, come back, I'm the warning
Come back, come back, breaker one (I'm the warning)
Come back, come back, breaker one

You seen the way
When I hold you tight
Asleep inside me
There is a slope like an appetite we descend slowly
And I fear my deep makeup
The ache inside go away
The vacant mind just delay
Some explosions from the bright side

Come back, come back, I'm the warning
Come back, come back, breaker one (come back, come back, breaker one)
Come back, come back, I'm the warning
Come back, come back, breaker one (I'm the warning)
Come back, come back, breaker one

You see the way how it happens right
This beast inside me
He leads the way
Then he's at my side
We feast til I'm starving
And I feel my deep makeup
The ache inside go away
Am I aping some old holiday
Some remnants of a wild side
I'm inclined
Cuz I've seen my dreams defined
And I'll take turns in stride
Just speed my feet away

Come back, come back, I'm warning
Come back, come back, breaker one

Days begun
Grace become
Babe this week I just
Went through so much darling
And I've seen my deep makeup
The ache inside go away
The patience to climb all day
The remnants of a mountain
I'm inclined
Cuz I need my needs to get by
And I've paid my turns in kind
Just speed my feet away

Come back, come back, I'm the warning
Come back, come back, breaker one---
