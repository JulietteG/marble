Kinda hard 
When I don't see you.... every day 

Kinda hard 
When I don't see you.... every day 

Kinda hard 
When I don't see you.... every day 

Kinda hard 
When I don't see you.... every day 

Kinda hard 
When I don't see you.... every day 

It's Every Time I... 

I don't know where I stand 
I don't know where to begin with you lady. 
I don't know what to do I don't know what to say..... 
Anymore to you, lady... 

I don't know what to do I don't know what to say 
anymore to you lady... 

It's kinda hard 
When I don't see you.. every day 

I don't know where I stand 
I don't know where to begin with you lady. 
I don't know what to do I don't know what to say 
anymore to you lady... 

Ohhhhhhhh... 
I don't want to feel like this no more. 
We're just lying to ourselves once more. 

We've got to move on we've got to go.... 
we can do this no more. 

Ohhhhhhhh... 
I don't want to feel like this no more. 
We're just lying to ourselves once more. 

We've got to move on we've got to go.... 
we can do this no more. 

oohhh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohhhh 

I don't know what to do I don't know what to say 
anymore to you lady... 

It's kinda hard 
When I don't see you every day 

It's kinda hard 
When I don't see you every day 

It's Every Time I... 

I don't know where I stand 
I don't know where to begin...... with you lady.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
