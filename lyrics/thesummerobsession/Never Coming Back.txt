What is going on in my head these days
Its like everything I know
Keeps slipping away
And Im left with my last drip of gas
To get me on my way to the ocean

Tip oh clock
I should be at my fucking job
And I cant bring myself
To stop giving up
Whats the point of living
If I aint living it up
Jump jump into my car

Roll the windows down
Turn the stereo up so loud
I cant hear you now
Im never coming back
Never coming back
To reality
Cause reality is illusion anyway

Low low is the battery to my phone
And my girlfriend calls 
She knows that Im not alone
And I dont care cause Im gone
And you dont own me anyway
(Own me anyway)
Save it for a rainy day

Roll the windows down
Turn the stereo up so loud
I cant hear you now
Im never coming back
Never coming back
To reality
Cause reality is illusion anyway

If all we are is dust
I must keep running away
Away
Cause it doesnt matter anyway

What is going on in my head these days
Its like everything I know keeps slipping away
And Im left with my last drop of gas
To get me on my way to the ocean

Roll the windows down
Turn the stereo up so loud
I cant hear you now
Im never coming back
Never coming back
To reality
Cause reality is illusion anyway
(Im never coming back)
Everything we do 
Everything we see
Everything we are is illusion
Cause reality is illusion anyway---Lyrics submitted by Ally.
