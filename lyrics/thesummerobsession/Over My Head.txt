The sun is going down
on this island I found
she is a girl surrounded by deadly seas
and I can sense in her eyes
she is nothing but lies
and I believed it was paradise

And Im such a fool
(Im such a fool)
I dont have a clue
why I dive in too deep
where the water is over my head
I dive into deep
where the water is over my head

Now Im on my back
sunk into the shore
all salty and dehydrated
I can see the irony
I believe its killing me
I dont need another thing to sink me

And Im such a fool
(Im such a fool)
I dont have a clue
why I dive in too deep
where the water is over my hear
I dive in too deep
where the water is over my head
I can see the irony 
I believe its killing me
(Im sinking im sinking)
I can see the irony 
I believe its killing me
(Im sinking Im sinking)

And Im such a fool 
I dont have a clue
why I dive in too deep

(over my head)
(over my head)

I dive into deep 
where the water is over my head
I dive into deep
where the water is over my head
where the water is over my head
where the water is over my head---Lyrics submitted by Ally.
