There in the summer
of my new obsession
all of my dreams 
started in the depression
eight in the morning
and I got your letter
sealed with a kiss
P.S. things will get better
and Id never say no to you
and Id never say no to you

Get me up early
(everything)
Im so motivated
(will be alright)
life as we know it
is so overrated
you are the best thing
(everything)
that Ive ever needed
(will be alright)
safe in this world
that is restless and greeted
and Id never say no to you 
(I would never say)
and Id never say no to you
(never say never say no)

You say 
(you say)
everything
(will be alright)
everything will be alright
you say
(you say)
everything
(will be alright)

Come to my rescue 
whenever I call
knock on my door 
if ever I fall

Come to my rescue 
whenever I call
(say you will)
(say you will)
(say you will)
(say you will)
knock on my door
if ever I fall
(just say you will)
(say you will)
(say)

You say
(you say)
everything
(will be aright)
everything will be alright
you say
(you say)
everything
(will be alright)
will be alright
(and Id never say no to you)
(and Id never say no to you)
(say you will) 
(say)
will be alright
(come to my rescue) 
(whenever I fall)
everything will be alright---Lyrics submitted by Ally.
