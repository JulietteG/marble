Imagine if we never lied
Imagine if we never tried
To be something we're not
We forgot how it feels
To be tight
To be close
To be real

And I miss you
And I wish you were here
I stopped breathing
When you said you don't care anymore

You're caught up in your plastic life
Changing right before my eyes
A chameleon 
I used to know you like the back of my mind
Did that part of you die

And I miss you
And I wish you were here
I stopped breathing
When you said you don't care anymore

And I'm scared
Don't don't leave me alone
I'm home having nothing
Anyway anyway
Standin' on the corner in the pouring rain
Gotta find a drug that will keep me sane
Like you

I watch you from a distance
I remember all of those instances
When you smile
Whe you laugh
When you crash
When I'm there to catch you when you fall

And I miss you
And I wish you were here
I stopped breathing
When you said you don't care anymore
(And I miss you)
Tell me that you're doing fine 
(And I wish you were here)
I still remember every time
(I stopped breathing)
And everyone I know will say
(When you said you don't care anymore)
That you are always apart of me
And I miss you like you never knew
And I miss you like you never knew---Lyrics submitted by lo.
