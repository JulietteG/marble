Im trapped in a world that I cant take
Where everythings unrealistic and fake
Im hiding out and planning my escape
I hope Im not the only one

Please come and rescue me tonight
I just wish that I could disappear
(Disappear)
Someone take me far away from here
(Far from here)
Do you suppose
Theres more to life out there

Theres no happiness surrounding me
Hate and ugliness is all I see
I wanna leave it all behind
Im running out of time

Please come and rescue me tonight
I just wish that I could disappear
(Disappear)
Someone take me far away from here
(Far from here)
Do you suppose
Theres more to life out there

And I dont wanna be blind
(I wanna open my mind)
I wanna know if theres a purpose to this life
Will I ever find it
Im running out of time
Running out of time

Im trapped in a world that I cant take
Hiding out and planning my escape

Please come and rescue me tonight
I just wish that i could disappear
Someone take me far away from here
Do you suppose
Theres more to life out there
I just wish that I could disappear
(Disappear)
Someone take me far away from here
(Far from here)
Do you suppose
Theres more to life out there
I just wish that I could disappear---Lyrics submitted by Ally.
