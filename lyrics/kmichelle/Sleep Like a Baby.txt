I wish I could hang like everything is fine
But forgiveness it's gonna take me some time
Till it's all day and night, this bed is a sinking boat
How can I keep it afloat?

Should I wake you up and let you know I'm breaking every night?
While you sleep like a baby, ooh oh
While you sleep like a baby, ooh oh
I'm angry inside, so many nights as I lay by your side
While you sleep like a baby, oh
While you sleep like a baby, ye-yeah

Let me calm down,
I'm tryina close my eyes
I can't believe you
You shared one smile
Laying underneath you
I know she's that good
Can't get on, should I?
Maybe I should try counting your lies

Should I wake you up and let you know I'm breaking every night?
While you sleep like a baby, ooh oh
While you sleep like a baby, ooh oh
I'm angry inside, so many nights as I lay by your side
While you sleep like a baby, oh
While you sleep like a baby, ye-yeah

You should be in this bed alone,
Oh oh
You should be in this bed all alone

Should I wake you up and let you know I'm breaking every night?
While you sleep like a baby, ooh oh
While you sleep like a baby, ooh oh
I'm angry inside, so many nights as I lay by your side
While you sleep like a baby, oh
While you sleep like a baby, ye-yeah---
