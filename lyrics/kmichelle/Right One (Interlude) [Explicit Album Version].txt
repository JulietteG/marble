[Chorus:]
You got the right one
You got the right one

[Verse 1:]
I just really hate you
All that game you've been runnin
Now it's time that I played you
And why I let you dump me?
Like don't why don't you rain right through me?
But you done find the right one nigga

[Pre-Chorus:]
Fuck you and all that
Blast on Twitter then I'm a blast back
You want a ratchet then I'm a be that
Don't make me call my boys and have yo shit peeled back
Oh you really don't know how you makin me feel
You make me wanna kill a man
Oh you really gonna make me show you how I feel
You got the right one, nigga

[Chorus:]
You got the right one
You got the right one

[Verse 2:]
Damn, I really hate you
I'm a say it again cause the truth is I made you
Now you out here frontin
And you was just that mean
In the rain
Why don't you even try to explain
See you know, I know the truth is do you wanna go there?
You got the right one, nigga

[Pre-Chorus:]
Fuck you and all that
Blast on Twitter then I'm a blast back
You want a ratchet then I'm a be that
Don't make me call my boys and have yo shit peeled back
Oh you really don't know how you makin me feel
You make me wanna kill a man
Oh you really gonna make me show you how I feel
You got the right one, nigga

[Chorus:]
You got the right one
(Now you gon see with who I'm dealin with)
You got the right one
(Now you gon see with who I'm dealin with)

[Verse 3:]
Don't wanna make up, don't wanna be homies
And when you see me act like you don't know me
You think you fly, you think you grown
Every since I left you been calling my phone
You ain't never gon find another chick like me
You ain't never gon find another chick like me, no

[Pre-Chorus:]
Fuck you and all that
Blast on Twitter then I'm a blast back
You want a ratchet then I'm a be that
Don't make me call my boys and have yo shit peeled back
Oh you really don't know how you makin me feel
You make me wanna kill a man
Oh you really gonna make me show you how I feel
You got the right one, nigga

[Chorus:]
You got the right one
(You got your getaway but I got your back)
You got the right one
(That's why you lost the game and I laughed at yo black ass)

[Outro:]
And that's the end
