There's a smile without a home
There's a heart that cant beat no more
How could she be the one you want
when I've given you so much
In this house we've made our own
you have tore it down to nothing
for the moment I'll be strong 
you let it all go 
Now she's calling your phone 
rolling her eyes at me like I'm the one who did wrong
trying to play my role

But I cant even Hate On Her
cause I know you got no heart 
I cant even hate on her
cause I know how low you go 
and you made it feel right 
when you know you was wrong
so I cant even hate on her
(Hate On Her)

See that moment it cant be erased 
memories they cant be replaced
how could you even look me in my face 
years ruined in one day
for a girl she don't even know
that grown boys don't never grow
she will always she will always feel alone
so when she's calling my phone 
next time ima let her know
she can have you I'm gone 
man love can be so cold

But I cant even Hate On Her
cause I know you got no heart 
I cant even hate on her
cause I know how low you go 
and you made it feel right 
when you know you was wrong
so I cant even hate on her
(Hate On Her)

ohhhh I've given my everything 
ohhhh but you took it all from me 
ohhhhhh I hope she can be all you need cause I cant be

I cant even Hate On Her
cause I know you got no heart 
I cant even hate on her
cause I know how low you go 
and you made it feel right 
when you know you was wrong
so I cant even hate on her
(Hate On Her)

ohhhh I've given my everything 
ohhhh but you took it all from me---Lyrics submitted by Mookie.
