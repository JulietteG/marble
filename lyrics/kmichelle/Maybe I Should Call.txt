Long distance in the way of what could be
Even when you're here, you're not with me
She's having the child I should of carry
I'll be damm if ya'll get marry
How's the baby, how you adjusting?
Ain't gonna work you got problems trusting
Let me stop, I'm suppose to be focus
But these nights are the coldest

Will you ever let her go? I don't know
Will I ever be first? I hope
But I ain't just sitting around
Can't wait for someone to sing my words
Damn, I can't compete with a baby
Is there any room left in your heart for me?

I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
Maybe I should call
Maybe I should call
I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
But I never call
Maybe that's my flaw

Maybe that's why I ain't got a man
'Cause I be too in too much thinking
Tryna compensate for your absence
But no drug can take me where you can
No, I just want you where I am
One thousand of them, just want one him
Hounding in along my excuses
Hardest and useless, probably should use it less

Will you ever let her go? I don't know
Will I ever be first? I hope
But I ain't just sitting around
Can't wait for someone to sing my words
Damn, I can't compete with a baby
Is there any room left in your heart for me?

I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
Maybe I should call
Maybe I should call
I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
But I never call
Maybe that's my flaw

After the last time we talked
Oh, I was a mess
You had me stressed
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
I wrote a text, I didn't send it
Dialed your number, but said forget it
Oh, why would it change?
She's still in the way, but

I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
Maybe I should call
Maybe I should call
I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
But I never call
Maybe that's my flaw---
