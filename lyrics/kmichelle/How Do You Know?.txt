I rather be poor
Then wrapped up in love
Can't seem to get it right
Can't seem to get it right
Fill me up
And still leave me a little dry
Love comes and cleans you up
Love's got a man made now

How can I forget about the past?
So we reinstart now again

How do you know?
How do you know?
When you gave him everything
And he still made a mess of things
How do you know?

Oh, it feels so good in the morning
But it's just the moment that will soon be over
While my thoughts is sober
And I'll trade it all love just to believe again
Looking for reasons why is never my time

How can I forget about the past?
So we reinstart now again

How do you know?
How do you know?
When you gave him everything
And he still made a mess of things
How do you know?

We don't understand his words until it hurts
Sometimes we're so blinded
And always reminded
What's all the fear made me mess it up again
Maybe it was me, maybe it was him
But I just don't know
Don't know which way to go

How do you know?
How do you know?
When you gave him everything
And you still made a mess of things
How do you know?---
