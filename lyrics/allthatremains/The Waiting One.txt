I am the waiting one it seems,
Days grow so long quickly,
Now how the quiet is released,
And I feel so lonely.

How did you think I would feel,
Threw me aside again,
How did you think I would feel.

Won't let you hurt me again now,
I'm nothing to you I can see,
Just walk away from me,
I'm torn up but I can't believe,
You sat and watched me bleed.

She knows the waiting one in me,
That I needed to hold you,
Still I can smell her nearing,
Feeling invited inside me.

How long I've waited,
Waited for you,
To come back to hold me,
What should I, what should I,
What should I do,
When I feel so lonely.

How could you do this to me,
Betrayed by my closest friend,
How could you do this to me.

Won't let you hurt me again now,
I'm nothing to you I can see,
Just walk away from me,
I'm torn up but I can't believe,
You sat and watched me bleed.

What should I,
What should I do,
Well how long I have waited,
What can I,
What can I do,
When I feel so lonely.

How did you think I would feel,
Threw me aside again,
How did you think I would feel.

Won't let you hurt me again now,
I'm nothing to you I can see,
Just walk away from me,
I'm torn up but I can't believe,
You sat and watched me bleed.

How could you do this to me,
Betrayed by my closest friend,
How could you do this to me,
I won't let you hurt me again.

I am the waiting one it seems.---Lyrics submitted by Phil.
