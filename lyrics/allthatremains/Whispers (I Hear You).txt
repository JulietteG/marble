It may seem at last, days passing mean nothing
But the sun that sets cause only pain 
Violence in words, like slashes, wound deeply
Love is not when you feel only pain

Her touch
Poison
Flows through my veins
No more
I denounce all your childish games 

Whispers 
I hear your
Poison
Flows in me
Lost inside you
I'm not free of you
Break my bonds again

Love lost
Arrogant whore
Paint strife on this canvas
Failure
I am a fool
I should have seen

Whispers
Poison
Break my bonds again (break my bonds again)
Love lost
Failure
I should have seen
I should have seen

Whispers 
I hear your
Poison
Flows in me
Lost inside you
I'm not free of you
Break my bonds again

No more
Lies
No more
Lies


No more
Lies
No more
No more lies


It may seem at last, days passing mean nothing
But the suns that set cause only pain 
Violence in words, like slashes, wound deeply
Love is not when you feel only pain

No more regrets
Face my fear alone
You made me
This I 
Break these bonds again

Whispers 
I hear your
Poison
Flows in me
Lost inside you
I'm not free of you
Break my bonds again

Lost inside you
I'm not free of you
Break my bonds again---Lyrics submitted by Tanya.
