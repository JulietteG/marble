The day has ended
I lay awake
A soft glow over my shoulder
I'll sleep soon
Wake tomorrow and then it's all the same

And I'll destroy the memories one by one
The bitter past erased
I'll not replace
What's done is done

No belief is all that's left and I do not regret
The darkness welcomes me back home

And I am still my own 
Can't take away
and i am still my own

And I feel the pain still deeply 
It seems sometimes too much to bear
I have a coure within me still
My strength is there

And I'll destroy the memories one by one
The bitter past erased
I'll not replace
What's done is done

No belief is all that's left and I do not regret
The darkness welcomes me back home

And i am still my own
and i am still my own
And I can't be made less
I know who I am
and i am still my own

you can not take away X4

And i am still my own
and i am still my own
And I can't be made less
I know who I am
and i am still my own....---Lyrics submitted by kyo.
