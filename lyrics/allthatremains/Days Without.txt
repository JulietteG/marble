And now destined to be 
The last one standing here 
The past alive to me 
And mocking hope is all I had 

In weakness it hides from me 
And then it infiltrates my heart 

So wrong to think I had found 
It was so long since I felt that at all 
I had dreamed long in days without 
I had so long wanted something much more 

Those looks so lovingly caressed 
My thoughts and still today 
They scream to me 
Their sweet warmth moistening my breath 

I may never get away 
I crave I hunger 

And still I leave behind 
This wreckage in my wake 
I was not long inside 
But still savor the taste 

I'd rather hate myself for failing 
Than hate myself for never having tried 
Nothing will fill me 
The way these passions do 
The feeling tempts me and warms me---Lyrics submitted by Tyler.
