Eyes fill with hatred 
When they fall upon me 
You worship gods of violence and bigotry 
Forgetting lessons learned that prove these 
The wrong ideals 

Don't let me follow in the footsteps 
I won't embrace these wrong ideals 
This thirst for violence, donmination 
It only serves your wrong beliefs 

This is my indictment of your beliefs 
This is my indictment of what you hold dear 

Your evil consumes you 
A jealous few incite ignorant followers 
Invoke the name and watch the masses turn on us 
For fear that I embody what you fear 

This is my indictment of your beliefs 
This is my indictment of what you hold dear 

My eyes have seen the horrors that you 
Commit in the name of your god 
Your god is violence, Your god is unholy 

Eyes fill with hatred when they fall upon me 

Invoke the name and watch the masses turn on us 
For fear that I embody what you fear 

Your god is violence, Your god is unholy---Lyrics submitted by Tyler.
