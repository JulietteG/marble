Packing your things and you storm through the house
Said, no, I can't take it, I just wanna end it
And all I can think, you look good when you're angry
So, lets take a step back and get us back on track

Mistakes that are made are the gifts that keep giving
Theres never a right time, except maybe this time

It's always something less than what I thought we had before
Like always, I'm blown away
But right now, I feel the need for something more
cause there's always, there's always right now

I'm not gonna let the emotions take over
This probably won't end well, but maybe I can't tell
Nothing will change, so just go through the motions
it's better in my mind, believing our own lie

Packing your things and you storm through the house said,
No, I can't take it, we needed to end it.
It's always something less than what I thought we had before
Like always, I'm blown away
But right now, I feel the need for something more
cause there's always, there's always right now---
