Let them hail the hollow one
Bow before the damned
Forge ahead into the night
Forget the lessons of the past
No remorse for the sinner
No repent for the waking dead
Hide their faces from the light
Let the past live again

We will set in motion
Changing of the times
We have not forgotten
We control our lives

Fallen feed on fallen now
Let the wretched have their fill
Feast not with the beast of old
Taste the fruit of ill will
We can band together now
Cast the dead from our site
Let them fall to massacre
Let the truth be our guide

We will set in motion
Changing of the times
We have not forgotten
We control our lives (x4)---Lyrics submitted by Tyler.
