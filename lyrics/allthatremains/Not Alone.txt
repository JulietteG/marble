No More,

No more are the days that I will
Fear for I have found a strength that
None can match and I'll push forward

Never has the blood in my viens
Flowed so fiercely as when i feel this around me
I am whole

I'm not alone
With the touch of your hand
I am whole again

I'm not alone
With the touch of your hand
I am whole again

Now I feel the passion burning
This what drives me further strengthens
My resolve to push me further

(and I believe, that I am not alone)
I'm not alone!

I'm not alone
With the touch of your hand
I am whole again

I'm not alone
With the touch of your hand
I am whole again

No more are the days that I will
Fear for I have found a strength that
None can match and I'll push forward

Now I feel the passion burning
This what drives me further strengthens
My resolve to push me further

I'm not alone (I'm not alone)
With the touch of your hand
I am whole again

I'm not alone (I'm not alone)
With the touch of your hand
I am whole again

(I am whole again)
(I am whole again)---Lyrics submitted by Kethlar.
