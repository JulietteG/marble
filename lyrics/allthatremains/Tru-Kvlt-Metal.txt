Same time, the exact same place
You've got the uniform on so clich
What a waste of my time

You are all the same
Destroy the name

Disgrace, or did you forget
All the things that made you stand out
Run in place
Can't go any farther

I won't be the same
Creating my own way

The pawn plays the king, but there's no board at all
The mindset of children that can't stand on their own
You raise up your hands in conformist salute
Will you follow the crowd or will you follow you?

I won't follow you

Who's left, they're dying off
Caving to the pressure from my enemies
Blank minds surround me

The flag you wave is dead
And you're too blame

Not bending to your ideals
Or manufactured rules you've put in place
This is not an altar

I won't be the same
Creating my own way

The pawn plays the king, but there's no board at all
The mindset of children that can't stand on their own
You raise up your hands in conformist salute
Will you follow the crowd or will you follow you?

I won't follow you

The pawn plays the king but there's no board at all

No more elitists, it's all in vein---
