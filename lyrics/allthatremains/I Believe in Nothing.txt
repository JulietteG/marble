Into a strange new world 
Into the after all your tears
Might find youve fallen too far 
Take another look, take another ride
Cant we make them leave their hate behind

And I still believe in nothing
Will we ever see the shape of tomorrow

Into the empty storm
Into the formless loss of hope
Where we can forget the game

And I still believe in nothing
Will we ever see the shape of tomorrow

Nothing is sacred when no one is saved
Nothings forever so count your days
Nothing is final and no one is real
Pray for tomorrow and find your empty still

Nothing is sacred when no one is saved
Nothing is forever so count your days
Nothing is final and no one is real
Pray for tomorrow and find youre empty
Nothing is sacred when no one is saved
Nothing's forever so count your days
Nothing---Lyrics submitted by Tyler.
