And how I love you I should let you go
Strike your name from my mind
Should I succeed from empty space
Filled with might have been

Wronged and I foul
Never cared for might have been

Your name etched upon my finger
Under gold still lives in my dreams
This day have fallen I away
Now my heart tattered on my sleeve
And I hear your breath lying next to me
Now my heart tattered on my sleeve
Will i see your name before mine

I am falling away
All my life
Is falling away
As time goes by---Lyrics submitted by Trevor.
