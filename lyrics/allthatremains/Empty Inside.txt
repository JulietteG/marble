I can't show pain 
Long for the days 
When I am free to feel

Don't want to lose everything 
Just want to feel again 
My heart would burst for you 
If that would make things right 

I don't feel anything 
Outside the pain you bring 
Starting over doesn't look so bad this time 

I am not empty inside 
Though I long, to make this right 

Emotions still touch me 
Still I can't feel a thing 
Like ghosts they melt into the fog 
and leave me cold 

Only shadows and impressions 
are left for me to hold 
My heart would burst for you if that would make you whole 

I am not empty inside 
Still I long, to make this right 
I am not empty inside 
Though I long, to make this right 

I am not empty inside 
Still I long, to make this right 
I am not empty inside 
(empty inside) 
Though I long, to make this right 
(make this right) 

Don't want to lose everything 
Just want to feel again 
My heart would burst for you 
If that would make things right 

I don't feel anything 
Outside the pain you bring 
Starting over doesn't look so bad this time 

I am not empty 
I am not empty 
I am not empty 
I am not empty---Lyrics submitted by Tyler.
