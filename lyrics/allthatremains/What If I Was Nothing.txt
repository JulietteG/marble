[Verse]
Just let it go don't want to argue anymore
I can't be sure I know just what are we fighting for
I know you're scared and that you're thinking I may go
I'm not leaving I'm not leaving

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you're thinking I might
Might be let astray
Just remember this one question

[Chorus]
What if I was nothing
What if this is true
What if I was nothing girl,
Nothing without you
So what if I was angry
What did you think I'd do
I told you that I love you ,girl
Nothing without you

[Verse]
I know it's hard it seems we're worked at this so long
It's often foolish pride that tells us we're not wrong
I hear your voice you tell me that you'll never go
And I believe it, I believe it

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you're thinking I might
Might be let astray
Just remember this one question

[Chorus]
What if I was nothing
What if this is true
What if I was nothing girl,
Nothing without you
So what if I was angry
What did you think I'd do
I told you that I love you ,girl
Nothing without you

[Bridge]
We can't keep this going on
We'll make it work some way
And every step it makes us stronger every day

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you're thinking I might
Might be let astray
Just remember this one question

[Chorus x2]
What if I was nothing
What if this is true
What if I was nothing girl,
Nothing without you
So what if I was angry
What did you think I'd do
I told you that I love you ,girl
Nothing without you ---
