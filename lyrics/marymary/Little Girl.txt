Hey Erica and Tina can you sing a song
About little girls for me, please

She was just 13 and I just don't think
That she ever seen her own beauty
She didn't think she'd be anything
And that little girl, she used to be me

Little girl, little girl
Wonder are you listening
Little girl, little girl
Struggling with your confidence
Little girl, little girl
God made you so beautiful
Little girl, little girl
I just thought that you should know

Sometimes you feel like you don't fit in
'Cause you don't look like all your other friends
You got your own thing going on
Girl you are so unique you are just
The way that God intended for you to be

Little girl, little girl
Wonder are you listening
Little girl, little girl
Struggling with your confidence
Little girl, little girl
God made you so beautiful
Little girl, little girl
I just thought that you should know

Tell you what you should do when you get up
In the morning look yourself in the mirror and say, "I love me"
Even with all of your flaws and all of your downfalls
Just be your best 'cause to Him you already are

Little girl, little girl
Wonder are you listening
Little girl, little girl
Struggling with your confidence
Little girl, little girl
God made you so beautiful
Little girl, little girl
I just thought that you should know

Little girl, little girl
Wonder are you listening
Little girl, little girl
Struggling with your confidence
Little girl, little girl
God made you so beautiful
Little girl, little girl
I just thought that you should know

Little girl, little girl
Little girl, little girl
Little girl, little girl---Lyrics submitted by Angel Bound.
