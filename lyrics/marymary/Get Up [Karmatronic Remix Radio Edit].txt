Layin' Low
Rest n' pause
Sleeping long
Slow motion
Gonna do
Shoulda, coulda, woulda done
Excuses

What are you afraid of?
Don't you know what you're made of?
One of God's greatest creations
Take this invitation now

Get Up
'Cause you can't stop
Get Up
Got a lot to do
24 hours
Almost gone
Get Up
Don't sit there
Get Up
If you wanna get there
Clocks don't stop and
Time won't wait

He said
She said
They said
What do you say?
It's your dreams
Your choice
Your time
Your life
So don't you
Don't you
Miss it

What are you afraid of?
Don't you know what you're made of?
One of God's greatest creations
Take this invitation now

Get Up
'Cause you can't stop
Get Up
Got a lot to do
24 hours
Almost gone
Get Up
Don't sit there
Get Up
If you wanna get there
Clocks don't stop and
Time won't wait

Welcome to the rest of your life
From now on, just try
To live more, want more, work a little harder
Dance more, laugh more, be a little smarter
Hug a little longer, love a little stronger
You've been down but now it's time to

Get Up
'Cause you can't stop
Get Up
Got a lot to do
24 hours
Almost gone
Get Up
Don't sit there
Get Up
If you wanna get there
Clocks don't stop and
Time won't wait [2x]

One more time, Say...
Get Up [x9]---Lyrics submitted by Carline.
