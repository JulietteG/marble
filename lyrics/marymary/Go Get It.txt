[Verse 1:]
It's like you're looking through a telescope you see where you gone be
Growing getting better you're not the person they see
Can't be mad at the things you been through cuz they built yo muscle
Now you're stronger than you ever been they can't stop yo hustle

Yo Faith ain't never small that's what brought you this far
See you got your dreams and you got your prayers and you got Yo God he gone take you there
See everyone has a season and I believe this one's yours
Cuz you been workin waitin this what you been prayin for

[Chorus:]
Go get it, Go Get it, Go get it, Go get it, Go get it
Go get yo blessing
Go get it, Go get it, Go get it, Go get it, Go get it, Go get it
It's yo time, it's yo time, it's yo time, it's yo time

[Verse 2:]
You were made to live a good life and that's what I believe
So hit the floor say a prayer start working you got to do something
It's alright to crawl before you walk it's alright to walk before you run
But if you wanna get what you never got gotta do something that you never done

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge:]
You've been qualified
But this mercy multiplied
You cannot be denied
Cuz you're finally certified
It's official
Go ahead and testify
He's gone bless you
You gone bless me
Now God be glorified

[Repeat Chorus 2x's]---
