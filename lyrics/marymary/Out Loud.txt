Out Loud
Out Loud
Say you care
Out Loud
Make a stranger's day
Make the world ok
With the words youll say 
Out loud

Out loud 
Out loud
Say youre glad 
Say youre proud
When your words reveal
That it's Love you feel
Heavy hearts will heal 
Out loud

Its not enough to think theyll always see it in your eyes
You cant be sure youll have another chance
Every time you see your loved ones, could be the last time that you will
So speak on someones behalf
Make her smile
Make him laugh

Out Loud
Out loud 
Say you care
Out loud
Dont assume they know
Dont just let it go
Always tell them so
Out loud

Its not enough to think theyll always see it in your eyes
You cant be sure youll have another chance
Cuz every time you see your loved ones, could be the last time that you will
So speak on someones behalf
Make her smile
Make him laugh

Out loud
Out loud
Say youre glad
Say youre proud

Help them soar above
Things they doubt for love
Love the ones you love
Out loud (2X)---Lyrics submitted by Diann Wilson.
