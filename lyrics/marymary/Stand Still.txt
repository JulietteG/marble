I am God, I am God, God

Erica: Thinking to yourself that you're by yourself
Yet still you're talkin' loud
But just tell who you were talking to 
If you don't believe I'm around
Said I'll never leave, so you're never alone
Even when you feel you are
I'm right here holding your hand, but still you think I'm way too far

Chorus: What do gotta do to make you understand that I want what's best for you 
and I always have, but maybe you're confused about who I really am
Stand still and know I'm God

Tina: You look at your life, then you wonder why your situation never changes
You blame it on them, you blame it on me
Maybe it's you thinking the wrong way
You should close your eyes, open them again
Maybe you'll see that I gave you life
And another chance to give me a chance
to take your wrong and make it right

Chorus

Bridge: Maybe you are only listening to what you want to hear
Simply follow my directions, everything will be so clear
I feel to the solution to every question that you ask 
the only way you've made it this far
is because I carried you here
