[hook]
I gotta get myself together, cuz I got someplace to go
And I'm praying when I get there, I see everyone I know
I wanna go to heaven, I wanna go to heaven, said I wanna go to heaven, I wanna go to heaven, do you wanna
Go?

[verse 1]
Can you picture a place where there a smile on every face
And all the worry, all the stressing, all the pressure's been erased
Walking down a street that's golden,
Angels singing perfect weather
Everybody's got a mansion, y'all it just don't get no better
I wanna go

[hook]

[verse 2]
The only way I can explain it, is that in life we go through changes
Though we know it serves a purpose, still sometimes it just seems
Worthless
But this race that I am running, whether I run it fast or slow
Long as I just keep on running, I'm gonna make it there someday
I know

[hook]

[bridge]
There's a place for us/one day I wanna see it
There's a place for us/and you may not believe it
But I'm just living my life/so I can live again
Everyday I'm getting ready/'cause I wanna make it in
