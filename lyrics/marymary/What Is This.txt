what is this that took my life and made it beautiful?
what is this that holds me close and never lets me go?
what is this that tells me better days are yet to come?
it's your love that gives new mercy every morning

what is this that gives me peace in every circumstance?
what is this that broke the chains and made me free at last?
all this love i have there's nowhere i can hide it
it's your loving i must tell the world about it

your love has captured me
(your love has captured me)
in ways i can't describe with mere words
i need so desperately
to be closer to you every minute of my life

what is this that wipes my tears when life is hard to bear?
what is this that takes my hand and leads me everywhere?
never leaves me nor forsakes me thats your promise
its your love and there is nothing else just like it

what is this that makes me want to live each day for you?
even though i cant repay the way you brought me through
what is this that makes me want to keep you smiling?
its your love, your sweet love that changed my life, yeah 

your love has captured me
(your love has captured me)
in ways i cant describe with mere words
i need so desperately 
to be closer to you every minute of my life

take my heart and make me over 
lord because i love you
youre my soul, my life, my source of everything
the very reason why i live each day in love
i live each day in love with you forever

take my heart and make me over
lord because i love you
youre my soul, my life, my source of everything 
the very reason why i live each day in love 
i live each day in love with you forever

take my heart and make me over
lord because i love you
youre my soul, my life, my source of everything
the very reason why i live each day in love
i live each day with you forever---Lyrics submitted by Takeria.
