[Chorus:]
I'm just ordinary people 
Who found extraordinary love
Sometimes it's hard to believe
That God keeps loving me so much

There are so many people I look up to
Used to tell them I wanna be just 
Like you
Then God took ordinary me
And gave me a chance
And everyday I gotta thank him for
Where I am

[Chorus]

I looked in the mirror, I saw average
You looked down from heaven, you saw
A gift
Still can't figure out why you
Loved me so but that's what makes 
You God
I guess I'll never know `cause

[Chorus]

Listen to me, I can tell you how it goes
God can take a nobody
Who no one knows
Make `em more than you ever could be
Ask me how I know, he did it for me
