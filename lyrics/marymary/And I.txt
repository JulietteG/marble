There's a name so powerful words can't describe
When spoken demons tremble
And all creation must bow down
(B-section)
Awesome are Your ways 
Everyday the same
And majesty is Your name
(Hook)
And I/Give You all my worship
And I/ Wanna sing Your praise
And I/ Long to honor You more than yesterday
(Verse 2)
There is not any other who can compare
To Your Word Your life
Your love's ultimate sacrifice
(B-section)
(Hook)
(Bridge)
You're everything no one else can be
You filled every space that was empty
Lord You are everything to me
(Hook)---Lyrics submitted by Debbie.
