(Hook)
Speak to me Lord
Speak a word of life
That I might hear
What thus sayeth oh God
It's the still small voice
That I wait for so
Speak to me Lord
(Verse 1)
Searching everywhere cuz we are looking for
The where's and why's and how to fill our deepest void
But Your words they bring all that we need 
So speak to me lord
(Hook)
(Verse 2)
Whether it be loud and clear
Or still and small 
Whether it be much
Or short and simple
Whatever it may be just as long as You
Speak to me Lord---Lyrics submitted by Debbie.
