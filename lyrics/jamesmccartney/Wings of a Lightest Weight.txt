Looking at you now
Realizing who you are
I've known you
I've known you all my life

One moment I'm arguing with you
Thinking I could put up a fight
But I only love you
I love you whoever is right
Then I think to myself
It couldn't be any other way

So I think to myself
It shouldn't be any other way
It wouldn't be any other way

Watching you fly away
Whilst your wings of a lightest weight
Carry you back
Through the heat of the wind
Carry you back to me

And I think to myself
It couldn't be any other way
So I think to myself
It shouldn't be any other way
It couldn't be any other way

Looking at you now
Realizing who you are
I have known you
I've known you all my life---Lyrics submitted by Natalie Skahan-Meier.
