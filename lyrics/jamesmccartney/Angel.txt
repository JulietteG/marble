Maybe I'm an angel 
Manifestation of them all 
Maybe I'm an angel 
Manifestation of them all
I have felt some hard times
In my life
but I don't to 
feel it anymore
I don't know what your think of
But it's okay
I just wanted you to 
say it anyway
Maybe you don't understand 
Just what I've been going through
Maybe your love will come 
And you really don't understand 
Anymore
And you don't 

Maybe I'm an angel 
Waiting to start to live my life
Maybe if you could make it 
Then that would be great
Let me tell you something 
That you don't know 
My love for you is
always been shown
I've had some hard times 
In my life
But I don't to feel it anymore
I don't know 
To you all
But really willing to try
Maybe you and I hear 
But I'm really going to die
Maybe you won't ever

Maybe I'm an angel
Maybe I'm an angel
True love at first sight 
True love at first sight
True love at first sight
Wow yeah yeah
True love at first sight
True love at first sight
True love at first sight
Wow yeah yeah
Maybe I'm an angel
True love at first sight
True love at first sight
Maybe I'm an angel---Lyrics submitted by Mike R.
