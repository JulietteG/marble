Still making to tell me, hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Tell the look in the mirror, say wassup, wassup
Hey, Im getting money, I hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Tell the look in the mirror, say wassup, wassup
Yeah, Im getting money, oh

They told me round my hood
What they say
Every time they see me I look good,
Yeah Im getting money

If you be hating just be mad at yourself
I bet you think this song is about you
Dont you, but I did it without you
Said this is for them kids Scooby handling their business
Got m ups to them haters cause were too busy winning
You cant tell us nothing, you cant tell me nothing
If you aint getting money then you aint got nothing on me
Cause Ill be getting paper like you wouldnt believe
And always getting haters like you wouldnt believe
So whassup Boy stop

 know nothing you can , you can buy you a chain but you cant buy the smith
Ima rock it like I talk it so youll never forget
And if you get your swag on let me hear you say
You wake up in the morning and you turn your swag on
Let me hear you say, oh, let me hear you say
I hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Tell the look in the mirror, say wassup, wassup
Hey, Im getting money, I hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Tell the look in the mirror, say wassup, wassup
Yeah, Im getting money, oh
I hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Tell the look in the mirror, say wassup, wassup
Hey, Im getting money, I hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Tell the look in the mirror, say wassup, wassup
Yeah, Im getting money, oh
I hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Tell the look in the mirror, say wassup, wassup
Hey, Im getting money, I hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Tell the look in the mirror, say wassup, wassup
