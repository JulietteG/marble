loca loca loca
dance of die

She playin dumb all the time just to keep it fun
to get you on like a.
Be careful amigo.
She talkin and walkin just to work you up.
Shed die for your love but your loves only mine now.
Sigo tranquila Like Im on a beach in Anguilla Sippin on Corona
 Like its nothin goin' on
I aint leavin you alone
What is meant for me
No other girl is gonna take
So keep him off

And Im crazy, but you like it (loca, loca, loca)
You like that it aint easy (loca, loca, loca)
Im crazy but you like it (loca, loca, loca)
Crazy but you like it

That girl is a nutter
Hot though, I heat up when I touch her
Chica caliente
Got me rapping to merengue
I feel so el presidente
Im runnin shit and Im lovin it
Shes got a mean lil butt,
But you should see what she does with it
She keeps it down low (down low, down low)
I can never get enough (oh no, oh no)
She gives me the runaround,
But I stay chasin
But I mean, yo, Im in love
With a crazy girl
But its all good
And its fine by me
Just as long as I hear her say, Ay, papi

And Im crazy, but you like it (loca, loca, loca)
You like that it aint easy (loca, loca, loca)
Im crazy but you like it
Crazy but you like it (loca, loca, loca)

Youre the one for me
And for her no more
Now you think shes got it all
I got one kiki

Youre the one for me
And for her no more
Now you think shes got it all
I got my kiki

Theres a lot of things
That Id do to please you
Take you to the medico por el caminito
Cuz were gonna get some Mambo
Oh, what she do in the Laui?

I really can't help it
If I make the lady loca
I dont want no trouble
I just wanna hit the (Ooh!)

And Im crazy, but you like it
Cause the kinda girl like me
Is never far from the market
And Im crazy, but you like it (loca, loca, loca)
You like that it aint easy (loca, loca, loca)
Im crazy but you like it (loca, loca, loca)
Crazy but you like it (Dios Mo)

That girl is (loca)
That girl is (loca)
That girl is (loca)

Loca
That girl is (loca)
That girl is (loca)

Youre the one for me
And for her no more
Now you think shes got it all
I got my kiki

And Im crazy, but you like it (loca, loca, loca)
You like that it aint easy (loca, loca, loca)
La loca, la loca, la loca (loca)
Loca (loca)---Lyrics submitted by lavander.
