SOS shes in disguise
SOS shes in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out coming out coming out

A domesticated girl that's all you ask of me
Darling it is no joke this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now with eyes wide open
My body's craving so feed the hungry

Ive been devoting myself to you Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused like a coffee machine in an office
So I'm gonna go to my closet and get me a lover and tell you all about it

There's a she wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free
There's a she wolf in the closet
Let it out so it can breathe

Sitting across a bar staring right at her prey
Its going well so far shes gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher and I'm her student

To locate the single men I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hot line in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys I just want to enjoy
By having a very good time and behave very bad in the arms of a boy

There's a she wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free
There's a she wolf in the closet
Let it out so it can breathe

SOS shes in disguise
SOS shes in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out coming out coming out

SOS shes in disguise
SOS shes in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out coming out coming out

There's a she wolf in the closet, let it out so it can breathe---Lyrics submitted by cheryl.
