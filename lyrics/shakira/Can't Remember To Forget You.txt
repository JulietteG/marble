I left a note on my bedpost
 Said not to repeat
 Yesterday's mistakes
 What I tend to do
 When it comes to you
 I see only the good
 Selective memory
 The way he makes me feel, yeah
 Gotta hold on me
 I've never met someone so different

 Oh here we go
 He a part of me now
 He a part of me
 So where you go I follow, follow, follow

 Oh, oh, oooh, oh
 Oh, oh, oooh, oh
 I can't remember to forget you
 Oh, oh, oooh, oh
 Oh, oh, oooh, oh
 I keep forgetting I should let you go
 But when you look at me
 The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
 Oh, oh, oooh, oh
 Oh, oh, oooh, oh
 I can't remember to forget you

 I can't remember to forget you

 [Rihanna]
 I go back again
 Fall off the train
 Land in his bed
 Repeat yesterday's mistakes
 What I'm trying to say is not to forget
 You see only the good, selective memory

 The way he makes me feel like
 The way he makes me feel
 I never seemed to act so stupid
 Oh here we go
 He a part of me now
 He a part of me
 So where he goes I follow

 [Chorus]
 Oh, oh, oooh, oh
 Oh, oh, oooh, oh
 I can't remember to forget you
 Oh, oh, oooh, oh
 Oh, oh, oooh, oh
 I keep forgetting I should let you go
 But when you look at me
 The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
 Oh, oh, oooh, oh
 Oh, oh, oooh, oh
 I can't remember to forget you

 I rob and I kill to keep him with me
 I do anything for that boy
 I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight
 I do anything for that boy

 I rob and I kill to keep him with me
 I do anything for that boy
 I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight
 I do anything for that boy

 Oh, oh, oooh, oh
 Oh, oh, oooh, oh
 I can't remember to forget you
 Oh, oh, oooh, oh
 Oh, oh, oooh, oh
 I keep forgetting I should let you go
 But when you look at me
 The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
 Oh, oh, oooh, oh
 Oh, oh, oooh, oh
 I can't remember to forget you

 But when you look at me
 The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
 Oh, oh, oooh, oh
 Oh, oh, oooh, oh
 I can't remember to forget you---Lyrics submitted by lauren wulf.
