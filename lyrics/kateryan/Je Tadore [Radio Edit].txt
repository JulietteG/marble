the sum of all my fantasies
thats everything you are to me

you came around and made my senses fly
shook me up when u took me to the sky
never thought i could ever get this high

jet'adore
i cant conceal it
jet'adore
anyone could seee it
you give me just a little more
of everything i waited for
jet'adore
heres my heart so take it
jet'adore 
only you can break it
you got me fallen to the floor
anyway you want i'm yours
ooooooh jet'adore

bye bye to all the lies  i've heard
you made a diffferent king of girl

you spun me out and made my senses fly
shook me up when you took me to the sky
never thought i could ever get this far

jet'adore 
i cant breathe without you
jet'adore 
i'm not me without you

your the rush i missed
made a wish i'd feel a kiss
just like this

jet'adore
yeah you made me feel it 
jet'adore
and i really mean it
you give me just a little more
of everything i waited for
jet'adore
heres my heart so take it
jet'adore
baby dont you break it
you got me fallen to the floor
anyway you want i'm yours
oooooooooh jet'adore---Lyrics submitted by Ada.
