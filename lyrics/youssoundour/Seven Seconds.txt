Don't see me from a distance
Don't look at my smile
And think that I don't know
What's under and behind me
I don't want you to look at me and think
What's in you is in me
What's in me is to help them
I assume the reasons that push us to change everything
I would like us to forget about their color
So they can try to be optimistic
Too many views on rave that make them desparate
Let's leave the door wide open
So they can talk about their pain and joy
Then we can give them information
That will bring us all together
Chorus:
It's not a second
7 seconds away
Just as long as I stay
I'll be waiting
Nothing can move us, we should be moving
from the ones who practice wicked charms
For the son and the stone
Bad to the bone
Man is not evil, even when it's born
And when a child is born into this world
It has no concept
The tone the skin is living in
(chorus)
There's a million voices
There's a million voices
To tell you what she should be thinking
so you better sober up for a second---Lyrics submitted by greg.
