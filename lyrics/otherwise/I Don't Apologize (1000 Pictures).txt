No I don't apologize,
For taking back the life that I deserve
It's like we took a thousand pictures, 
Just to watch them burn
And with every moment wasted, 
It doesn't feel like anything was learned
After the fall...

I'd rather be blind than to see your eyes
I'd rather be deaf than to hear your lies
I'd rather be broke than to sell my soul
I gave you my all, but you'll never know...

No, I'm not gonna hurt anymore
I've already walked through that door
All of this time, could've moved on,
Should've known better than this
And I hope it hits you right between the eyes
I don't apologize

And I don't apologize,
For all the times you said that I was wrong
You scattered all the pieces,
You couldn't just leave good enough alone
And with every step you're taking, 
It's cutting even deeper to the bone
We could've had it all...

No, I'm not gonna hurt anymore
I've already walked through that door
All of this time, could've moved on,
Should've known better than this
And I hope it hits you right between the eyes
I don't apologize
I don't apologize

I'd rather be blind than to see your eyes
I'd rather be deaf than to hear your lies
I'd rather be broke than to sell my soul
I gave you my all, but you'll never know...

No, I'm not gonna hurt anymore
I've already walked through that door
All of this time, could've moved on,
Should've known better than this
And I hope it hits you right between the eyes
I don't apologize
No, I don't apologize
I don't apologize

It's like we took a thousand pictures,
Just to watch them burn...---Lyrics submitted by Chris Tito.
