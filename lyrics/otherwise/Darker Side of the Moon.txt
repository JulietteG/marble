All my stars are falling
All my lives are in decline
All my sins are calling
Trying to lay claim on what's mine

Save me!
There ain't no wrong or right
Take me!
To the other side

Darker side of the moon yeah
Light up, light up our only savior
Darker side of the moon yeah
Hiding from the light's the only way to survive

All my strength is fading
Still I struggle claw and fight
As I lie in waiting
I pass quick from day to night

Save me!
There ain't no wrong or right
Take me!
To the other side

Darker side of the moon yeah
Light up, light up our only savior
Darker side of the moon yeah
Hiding from the light's the only way to survive

Looking for a save! Looking for a savior!
Looking for a save! Looking for a savior!

Darker side of the moon yeah
Light up, light up our only savior
Darker side of the moon yeah
Light up the night so we can stay here

Darker side of the moon yeah
Light up, light up our only savior
Darker side of the moon yeah
Hiding from the light's the only way to survive

Looking for a save! Looking for a savior!
Looking for a save! Looking for a savior!
Looking for a save! Looking for a savior!

Looking for a save! Looking for a save! ---
