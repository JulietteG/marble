Trapped behind this tangled steel,
At a loss for words
I don't know how I really feel,
did I get what I deserved?
A second chance or second curse,
I struggle to decide
The ambulance outran the hearse,
you sure you wanna ride?

(Chorus)
There's something about the way you move
That I can't explain
There's something about the light in you
And it takes away the pain

The metal tears into my flesh, and poisons me inside
But I won't be silenced like the rest,
I'll never let this die
'Cause broken bones can't break my soul,
Or take away my pride
I'm gonna steal your precious heart of gold
I want you by my side

(Chorus)

Bring me your light!!!

(Chorus)

It takes away the pain
You take away the pain...
You take away the pain...---Lyrics submitted by Chris Tito.
