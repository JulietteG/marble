Waiting for your very own star
I don't wanna be the one to say it
I don't wanna be the one to make you 
Take it so bravely
How am I supposed to feel when you're gone?
I don't wanna see you live like this for long
To live this way is wrong...

(Chorus)
Crimson is on the floor and falling
Losing your silent war
Go and find your freedom now
Now it's your time to break away
There's nothing I can do to make you stay
Go and find your fury now
Now it's your time to let it out
Never look back, don't turn around

Slowly but surely
I just wanna help you find your way home
I don't wanna see you laid out to the bone
You know you're not alone

(Chorus)

Crimson is on the floor
Losing your silent war

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Chris Tito.
