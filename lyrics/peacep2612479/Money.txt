Welcome little teethers
Welcome to our world
Where big coins pay for beatings
And diamonds pay for girls
So go find all the pennies
That ones that people ditch
You're going to be happy
You're going to be rich

Money
Do you need it?
Do you eat it when you're hungry?
Does it taste good?

The man who's made of money
Was terrible to kiss
Not because he's sloppy
Because his paper lips
Stuck to you on contact
But as you seize they rip
You here the world is spinning
It's not the coin that flips
Money
Do you need it?
Do you eat it when you're hungry?
Does it taste good?

Find me something new to chew, oh
Grant me anything because all I want is everything but settling
Take.
Strong.

On the writing on the paper wall
The lino on the filthy floor
Is anybody out there, growing slowly out?
You were never happy, eyes not enough
Supersize me never dies me

Money
Do you need it?
Do you eat it when you're hungry?
Does it taste good?---
