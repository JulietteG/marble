I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna write words, oh, so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet.
A lotta kisses on the bottom, I'll be glad I've got 'em

I'm gonna smile and say "I hope you're feelin' better"
Then close "with love" the way that you do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter, ah-huh
I'm gonna make believe it came from you

-lengthy instrumental break-

I'm gonna sit right down   write myself a letter, oh, babe
And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna write words, oh, so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lotta kisses on the bottom, I'll be glad I've got 'em

I'll smile and say "I hope you're feelin' better"
Then close "with love" the way that you do
I'm gonna sit right down, write myself a letter, oh yeah
I'm gonna make believe it came from you---Lyrics submitted by katie patterson.
