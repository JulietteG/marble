Oh my name is Jock Stewart
Im a canny Gaun Man
and a roving young fellow I've been
So be easy and free 
when you're drinking with me
Im a man you don't meet everyday 

I have acres of land 
I have men at command
I have always a shilling to spare
So be easy and free 
when you're drinking with me
Im a man you don't meet everyday

So come fill up your glasses
with brandy and wine
Whatever it costs I will pay
So be easy and free when your drinking with me
I'm a man you don't meet everyday

Well I took out my dog and him I did shoot
all down in the county Kildare
so be easy and free 
when your drinking with me
I'm a man you don't meet everyday

So come fill up your glasses 
with brandy and wine
whatever it costs I will pay
so be easy and free 
when your drinking with me 
I'm a man you don't meet everyday.---Lyrics submitted by Daniel.
