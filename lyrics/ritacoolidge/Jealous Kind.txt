Don't be angry if I seem blue each time we meet
Someone that you once knew, that you say used to be so close to you
Is this that I'm so afraid someone might steel away I'd loose my mind
That I can't help my self the way I feel sometimes I'm the jealous kind.

It was alright when I first met you I didn't min d
But now the things have changed I'm not the same and now I fight
I walk through often myself no wanna sahre you with nobody else
You must forgive me for the way I act sometimes I'm the jealous kind

If you only knew how much it hurts to hear you say
how you can't forgive ever fallen me for the good old days
Why must you hurt me so I can't take it no more and I really try
That I can't help my self the way I act sometimes I'm the jealous kind.

SOLO

Don't be angry if I seem blue each time we meet
Someone that you once knew, that you say used to be so close to you
Is just that I'm so afraid someone might steel away I'd loose my mind
That I can't help my self the way I feel sometimes I'm the jealous kind.
