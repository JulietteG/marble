Dougla Woman (1999) (David Rudder)

Dougla woman, spin your magic over me
Dougla woman, light me fire set me free
Dougla woman, spin your magic over me 

Dougla woman, eyes so bright like a shining star 
Dougla woman, you mix my mind up, like you are
Dougla woman, spin your magic over me 

Dougla woman, let me understand your soul 
Dougla woman, turn this feeling into gold 
Dougla woman, spin your magic over me---Lyrics submitted by Louanne Regis.
