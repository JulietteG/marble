The sum of all my fantasies
That's everything you are to me

You came around and made my senses fly
Shook me up when you took me to the sky
Never thought that I could ever get this high

Je t'adore
And I can't conceal it
Je t'adore
Anyone can see it
You give me just a little more
Of everything I've waited for
Je t'adore
Here's my heart so take it
Je t'adore
Only you can break it
You got me fallen to the floor
Anyway you want I'm yours
Ooh je t'adore

Bye bye to all the lies I've heard
You made a different kind of girl

You spun me out and you made my senses fly
Shook me up when you took me to the sky
Never thought that I could ever get this high

Je t'adore
And I can't conceal it
Je t'adore
Anyone can see it
You give me just a little more
Of everything I've waited for
Je t'adore
Here's my heart so take it
Je t'adore
Only you can break it
You got me fallen to the floor
Anyway you want I'm yours
Ooh je t'adore

You're the rush that I missed
Made a wish that I'd feel a kiss
Just like this

Je t'adore
Yeah you made me feel it
Je t'adore
And I really mean it
You give me just a little more
Of everything I've waited for
Je t'adore
Here's my heart so take it
Je t'adore
Baby don't you break it
You got me fallen to the floor
Anyway you want I'm yours
Ooh je t'adore---Lyrics submitted by Ans Nantucket.
