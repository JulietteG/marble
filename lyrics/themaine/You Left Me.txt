Oh, you left me with a broken heart
And now I see you as I should've from the start
Oh, you left me with nothing but a kiss
And now I'm leaving you with these lips
These lips

Everything looked fine from here
Everything looked more than clear
But now you are gone
And I'm still here

So check it out (so check it out)
I wrote it down (I wrote it down)
In case you ever left us out
And baby you can't fire me
'Cause I quit right now

Oh, you left me with a broken heart
And now I see you as I should've from the start
Oh, you left me with nothing but a kiss
And now I'm leaving you with these lips

Whoa whoa (You left me)
Whoa whoa (You left me)
Whoa whoa (You left me)
whoa whoa (Baby, baby)
[x2]

So now I'm pressin'
But I ain't stressin'
She's got a man
I'm with her best friend
Tried at love but it never really stuck
She said it's love but I didn't give a fuck

Oh, you left me with a broken heart
And now I see you as I should've from the start
Oh, you left me with nothing but a kiss
And now I'm leaving you with these lips

Whoa whoa (You left me)
Whoa whoa (You left me)
Whoa whoa (You left me)
whoa whoa (Baby, baby)
[x2]

You left me
You left me
Baby

And now I'm better cause you left me
I just left 'cause you let me
Don't keep calling, just forget me
Don't keep calling, just forget

Oh, you left me with a broken heart
And now I see you as I should've from the start
Oh, you left me with nothing but a kiss
And now I'm leaving you with these lips

Whoa whoa (You left me)
Whoa whoa (You left me)
Whoa whoa (You left me)
whoa whoa (Baby, baby)
