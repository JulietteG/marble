ot caught running up a tab
Couldn't drive home so I had to share a cab
Introduced herself by her last name
The kind of girl you steal from the football team
Brought up a silver spoon mess
Always trying to tear off her Catholic dress
Told me she's over this place
Needs to feel the mid west wind in her face
But the alcohol made its way down
She was the last thing that I saw last night before I hit the ground


Oh god I did the wrong thing to the right girl
My mind was only in it for a minute
Had a bad fling with a good girl
I was stupid and dumb not giving a
The blank stare out the window
If I could just sober up I could just admit
I did the wrong thing to the right girl
It was your world, baby and I just lived in it
It was your world, baby and I just lived in it

I've never been the best with my mouth
Try to stay smart but the dumb comes out
Maybe I'm shy, I drive an old car
Maybe I'm amazed that I got this far
And I got my stand-bys waiting on the line
But the hardest part is knowing that it won't be her this time

CHORUS :
Oh god I did the wrong thing to the right girl
My mind was only in it for a minute
Had a bad fling with a good girl
The blank stare out the window
If I could just sober up I could just admit
I did the wrong thing to the right girl
I was stupid and dumb not giving a
It was your world, baby and I just lived in it
It was your world, baby and I just lived in it

Please, please, baby come back
Please, please, baby come back
Please, please, baby come back
Please, please, baby come back

She came back
Thought she had it all planned out
Went to marry some guy she had talked about
A tear in her dress and a tear in her eye
And just like that her whole life flashed by
She won't remember what you said last night
That if you ever needed someone to pick up the pieces in your life

CHORUS :
Oh god I did the wrong thing to the right girl
My mind was only in it for a minute
Had a bad fling with a good girl
I was stupid and dumb not giving a
The blank stare out the window
If I could just sober up I could just admit
I did the wrong thing to the right girl
It was your world, baby and I just lived in it
It was your world, baby and I just lived in it
Oh, it was your world---Lyrics submitted by marcie.
