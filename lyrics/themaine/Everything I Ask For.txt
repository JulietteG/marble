She takes her time with the littlest things
Love notes reminding me
She wears red when she's feeling hot (SO HOT!)
I have her but that's all I've got
She looks best without her clothes
I know it's wrong but that's THE WAY IT GOES

I don't know what she sees in me
But I'm happy that she's happy now
That she's with me
And I'm freakin' out
Because I'm just so lucky

Oh she makes me feel like shit
It's always something
But I can't get over it
She thinks it's nothing
Because she's
Everything I ask for
Everything I ask for
And just a little bit more
Everything I ask for
Everything I ask for
And so much more

She loves music but she hates my band
Loves Prince she's his biggest fan (Ow!)
She's not big on holding hands
But that's alright cause I've still got her
She keeps up on current affairs
PRADA IS WHAT SHE WEARS

I don't know what she sees in me
But I'm happy that she's happy now
That she's with me
And I'm freakin' out
Because I'm just so lucky

Oh she makes me feel like shit
It's always something
But I can't get over it
She thinks it's nothing
Because she's
Everything I ask for
Everything I ask for
And just a little bit more
Everything I ask for
Everything I ask for
And so much more

Fist fights turn into sex
I wonder what comes next
She loves to always keep me guessing

And she (SHE!)
won't (WON'T)
give it up.
And we (WE!)
Both (BOTH)
know it's because...

Oh she makes me feel like shit (makin' me feel like shit!)
It's always something
But I can't get over it
She thinks it's nothing
Because she's
Everything I ask for
Everything I ask for
And just a little bit more
Everything I ask for
Everything I ask for
And just a little bit more
Everything I ask for
Everything I ask for
And so much more
Everything I ask for
Everything I ask for
And so much more---Lyrics submitted by Rebekah.
