Shes fresh to death, 
Shell be the death of you.
Seduction leads to destruction.
Shes fresh to death, 
Shell be the death of me.
Shes fresh, shes fresh, but not so clean.

Cute face, slim waist.
Shes got him in a craze, 
Yeah we think hes goin crazy.
And she speaks and makes me grind my teeth.
Yet he still thinks, shes amazing. 
And shes been playin' games,
Ever since 98.
Shallow is, as shallow does, yeah
Some people never change.

And shes so fine
She thinks she so damn fine
She might be fine
But she aint worth a second of your time

Your as fake as the moans you make
And your as weak as the hearts you break
Your as fake as the moans you make
So just give us
Give us a little break
Cmon and give me a break

Sex cells and your sex cells make all the lost boys drool
Cuz your a dime but they'll have to wait in line
until one of them makes it two of you

Cute face, slim waste
Still got him in a craze
Yeah i think im goin crazy
Ive got a long list of things to say
But ill leave it at, you amaze me

And shes so fine
She thinks she so damn fine
She might be fine
But she aint worth a second of your time

Your as fake as the moans you make
And your as weak as the hearts you break
Your as fake as the moans you make
So just give us, give us a little break

Shes fresh to death, Shell be the death of you
Seduction leads to destruction
Shes fresh to death, Shell be the death of me
Shes fresh, shes fresh, but not so clean
Shes fresh to death! Shell be the death of me!
Your as fake as the moans you make
And your as weak as the hearts you break
Your as fake as the moans you make
So just give us, give us a little break

Your as fake as the moans you make
And your as weak as the hearts you break
Your as fake as the moans you make
So just give us, give us a little break
Cmon and give me a break
Yeah give me a break---Lyrics submitted by Annie.
