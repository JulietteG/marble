its time to go so 
put all your clothes on.
i've got the keys
baby your so gone.

it's time to go 
so put on all our clothes.
we're running late 
and we both know.

cause you've got your plans 
and you know that i have mine
but we'll fade away
we have so little time.

so tonight, tonight
let's fade away (let's fade away)
forget it all
for just one day.
tonight, tonight. 
oh baby we'll fade away. 
this is our time
oh yeah

so baby it's time to...

get on the dance floor.
pretend you know how.
to make 'em all scream.
you're what they're
talkin about.

they said it's time
to go. half dressed
just walkin' out the
door. and i just 
thought that i would 
try to let you know.
we'll be a mess around
3 or 4. we all know that
i'm fine to go.---Lyrics submitted by Christina.
