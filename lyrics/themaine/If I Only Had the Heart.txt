I fell asleep last night.
well i woke up today.
And everything I loved.
I begin to hate.

I know I sound repetitive,
Cause I'm repeating myself,
And I'm competitive,
I want you all by yourself.
And that alone is just the problem,
I've got these woes,
And I just can't solve them.
If I could gather up the nerve,
I'd put my feelings into words,
And if I weren't so young, or stupid, or restless,
I might be able to just to forget this.
Just forget this.

Please just forget me,
When I'm out all alone on the east coast.
And please don't forgive me,
When you're home all alone and you need me most.

Oh when you need me most. 
Yeah when you need me most. 

Oh if I only had the heart,
To find out exactly who you are,
You know I try now.
But it's just fine,
No you can't save me,
It's no fault but mine,
Please just blame me.
If I could gather up the nerve,
I'd put my feelings into words,
And if I weren't so young, or stupid, or restless,
I might be able to just to forget this.
Just forget this.

Please just forget me, 
when I'm out all alone on the east coast. 
And please don't forgive me, 
when you're home all alone and you need me most. 

Oh, when you need me most. 
Yeah, when you need me most. 

Oh if i only had the heart.
Oh if I only had the heart. 
Oh if I only had the heart. 
Oh if I only had the heart. [the nerves, the words, you'd think by now I would have learned]

Please just forget me, 
when I'm out all alone on the east coast.
And please just forgive me, 
when you're home all alone and you need me most. 

Yeah when you need me most. 
Oh when you need me most.---Lyrics submitted by isobel.
