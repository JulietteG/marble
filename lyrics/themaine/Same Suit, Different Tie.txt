Different tie
But I'm wearing the same suit
It's alright
Because the old can feel brand new
See I feel so fresh
I feel so new
And I'm through with my
With my miserable youth

All done up in my hand-me-down clothes
Shaking off the dust and assuming a pose
Well these threads are so old
But they'll never know
Oh no one will ever know
See darlin'
Dear you don't need high-priced designs
To feel dressed up, to feel dressed up
To the nines

Different stride
But I'm wearing the same shoes
It's alright
Because the old can feel brand new
I feel so fresh
(and electric)
I feel so new
(and improved)
And I'm through with
(Yes I'm through with)
My miserable
Oh that invisible youth

All done up in my hand-me-down clothes
Shaking off the dust and assuming a pose
Well these threads are so old
But they'll never know
Oh no one will ever know
See darlin'
Dear you don't need high-priced designs
To feel dressed up, to feel dressed up
To the nines

You don't need much of anything
To feel lush once in a while
No you don't need much of anything
Just a strut and a little style
Just a strut and a little style
Well these threads are so old

All done up in my hand-me-down clothes
Shaking off the dust and assuming a pose
Well these threads are so old
But they'll never know
Oh no one will ever know
See darlin'
Dear you don't need high-priced designs
To feel dressed up, to feel dressed up
To the nines---
