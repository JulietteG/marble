I'm taking taking, all of my time
I'm dodging words but you're saying the right lines
She made me, made me, oh so crazy
But this time I feel like I'm doing something right.

It made me sick to think about, everything you put me through
and how you left without (sayin' goodbye)
and if its really over now,
you can walk away.
and it will be the last time.

This is the end,
of you and me.
Everything i use to be, back then
it meant somethin'
but you're livin' a lie and you just can't hide from me.

You had me hanging on you're last word,
and now in feeling, a little less entrusting.
You had me wishing we were something,
but left me here with a whole lot of nothing now.

This is the end,
of you and me.
Everything i use to be, back then
it meant somethin'
but you're livin a lie and you just can't hide from me.

"Love is a luxury." she said. "I'd rather be in love then dead."
But not with her, oh god, not with her.
She's the type of girl that makes love,
hurt.

(I'm taking taking all of my time)
(Im dodging words but you're saying the right lines)
(She made me made me oh so crazy)
(but this time i feel like I got it right)
(Two, three, four, one.)

This is the end,
of you and me.
Everything i use to be, back then
it meant somethin'
but you're livin' a lie and you just can't hide from me.---Lyrics submitted by Christina.
