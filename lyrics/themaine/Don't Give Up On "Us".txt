I am weakness, I am greatness,
I'm anything, you want me to be
I am wasted, and I'll make this
The anthem for a dying breed

See the light in the night when you're fading away
Trust in us, we're all that you've got these days
Take a look inside my heart
Oh, lets get carried away

Don't you dare, don't you ever give up,
Don't you ever give up, oh whoa
Don't you dare, don't you ever give up,
Don't you ever give up on us, my dear

I am selfless, I am selfish,
I'm anything, that I want to be
This is violent, this is honest,
It's the anthem for a dying breed

See the light in the night when you're fading away
Trust in us, we're all you've got these days
Take a look inside these eyes
Oh, lets get carried away

Don't you dare, don't you ever give up,
Don't you ever give up, oh whoa
Don't you dare, don't you ever give up,
Don't you ever give up on us my dear

Don't give up on us
No, don't give up on us

Don't give up on us
No, don't give up on us

Don't you dare, don't you ever give up,
Don't you ever give up, oh whoa
Don't you dare, don't you ever give up,
Don't you ever give up on us, my dear---Lyrics submitted by skye.
