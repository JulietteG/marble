Another part with the same kids, another night with the same drinks
I need to find myself a new chick
I need to kiss a set of new lips

She's gotta be something new to me
Fresh face, someone new to please
So come on, come on girl, just you and me
Oh come on girl, just you and me

This kind of girl makes it rough (makin' it rough)
Holding our breaths while we touch
She won't kiss and tell, but this isn't hell
She got that name, it all seem like a game
How she is so well, I won't call this hell
If I had to guess, I'd say we have a mess you could sell

And how am I supposed to think, with her hand all over me
Telling me the right things, ever so distracting

She's gotta be something new to me
Loose Ends, But no sight of strings
So come on, come on girl, just you and me
Oh come on girl, just you and me

This kind of girl makes it rough (makin' it rough)
Holding our breaths while we touch
She won't kiss and tell, but this isn't hell
She got that name, it all seem like a game
How she is so well, I won't call this hell
If I had to guess, I'd say we have a mess you could sell

She's makin' it harder, harder to breathe
I'm gettin' weaker, so pullin' the strings

The lights are all lost, there's no one around
We've both lost our minds, nowhere to be found
It's gettin' hot, I'm not saying this is hell
but I swear, this girl's a mess you could sell

She won't kiss and tell, but this isn't hell
She got that name, it all seem like a game
How she is so well, I won't call this hell
If I had to guess, I'd say we've got a mess you could sell---Lyrics submitted by Shawna.
