It's funny how this bad taste in my mouth
Only lasts until I spit it out
I was wasted, my mind was racing
All throughout our conversation
Chris, it doesn't take too much
Her face, it's quite enough
The blood ran from her nose
As the blood ran from her nose

Oh oh oh
What are we doing here?
Oh oh oh
Christina
Please don't call here anymore
Christina
Oh it's not me, it's you
Only did it because I wanted to

It's funny how this bad taste in my mouth
Lasts until I forget about how it feels to feel this way
Feels like just the other day
When we were kids
Never thought it'd come to this
Laugh, then we take a hit
You look so criminal
I feel just like a criminal

Oh oh oh
What the fuck am I doing here?

Oh oh oh
Christina
Please don't call here anymore
Christina
Oh it's not me, it's you
Only did it because I wanted to

I cannot wait to see your face
When you come crawling back to me
I cannot wait to see your face
When you come crawling back to me
I cannot wait to see your face
When you come crawling back to me
Crawling back to me
Oh, I cannot wait to see your face
When you come crawling back to me
Crawling back to me

Christina
Please don't call here anymore
What the fuck am I doing here?
Christina
Oh it's not me, it's you
Only did it because I wanted to---
