This one goes out to my closest friends
The ones who make me feel less alien
I do not think I would be here if not for them
See all the nights in shitty bars
Throwing up in taxi cars
Or on our backs under the stars
As we sang, as we sing

What's another night on Mars?
With friends like ours
Anywhere is home

This one goes out to my closest friends
The ones who make me feel less alien
I do not think I would be here if not for them
See all the nights in shitty bars
Throwing up in taxi cars
Or on our backs under the stars
As we sang, as we sing

What's another night on Mars?
With friends like ours
Anywhere is home

The Earthlings crawl from bar to bar
Ignoring shooting stars
And grinding all the gears
The atmosphere here on Mars
Oh lord it's quite bizarre
And will remain this way for years and years and years
Yup

What's another night on Mars?
With friends like ours
Anywhere is home---
