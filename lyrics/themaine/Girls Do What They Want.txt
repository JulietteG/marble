She's eighteen and a beauty queen
She makes the boys feel so weak
It's all for her, or none at all
She'll pick you up just to watch you fall.
It's those hands, on those hips, I can't escape 'em
It's that mouth, and those lips, try not to taste 'em

That's just the way that things are;
And that's how they'll always be

Girls do what they want (whoa-a, whoa-a)
Boys do what they can
Girls do what they want (whoa-a, whoa-a)
Boys do what they can

She's eighteen and a beauty queen
She's figured out all the boys like me
Head to toe, you know she's dressed to kill
And she could the way she's lookin at me
It's her face, and those eyes, I can't escape 'em
It's that mouth and those lies, try not to taste 'em

That's just the way that things are
And that's the way they'll always be

Girls do what they want (whoa-a, whoa-a)
Boys do what they can
Girls do what they want (whoa-a, whoa-a)
Boys do what they can

That's just the way that things are
Because the boys are feeling jealous
And it just doesn't make any sense
Go on and tell 'em why the girls are 
Into fellas that toss 'em to the side in the end
And you know that all the
The boys are falling in love 
With girls who don't know whats up
I think we've all had enough of this now
These kids are talkin' bout love
I think we've all had enough
We've all had enough of this now

Girls do what they want (whoa-a, whoa-a)
Boys do what they can
Girls do what they want (whoa-a, whoa-a)
Boys do what they can---Lyrics submitted by Martyna.
