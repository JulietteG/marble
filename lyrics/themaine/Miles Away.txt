I took a trip up the west coast
LAX to SFO
Was searching for a temp so low
And a summer high
The Sun swayed and set slow
Made waves with some friends I know
Got lost in the ebb and flow
Of the drifting tide
(And I)

I didn't ever want to come down
From that west coast rush and summer high
And easy, peaceful sense of time
(I felt so alive)
Now I'm alone when I'm back home
It's cold and old
But in my mind
I
I am
Miles and miles
Away

Pretty pretty girls on two wheels
Dolores Heights and a laid back feel
We sat and drank for a while until
The city came alive
We were smoking with strangers
We were dancing with the lights on
I was singing to "The Angels"
See that's my favorite X song

In my mind I'm miles away

When the buzz ain't like it was
Well then it's time for a change
Just a subtle change
A tongue full of only tomorrow's
Will never quench your thirst for today
So what do you say we take a trip miles away---
