Somethings are out of my hands
I'm what time and consequences made me
Sit back and watch the world explode
3-2-1 here come the fireworks baby

Sometimes, you can feel so small
Just like a ghost in school clothes
My days are mostly hazy
3-2-1 Here comes the hurricane baby

Yeahh, Identify, Identify (2x)

Don't stand in line, identify

(Yeahh, I bought the last plane ticket to the end of the world)

(Time to give 'em what they're waitin for)

Yeahh, Identify, Identify (2x)
Don't stand in line (Don't stand in line, Identify, Identify)
