Well where i come from
You learn to take it nice and slow
But baby since we met
Oh its been go go go

See you can rough me up
Ya baby you can earn me too because all i got
You see all i got is you
So you can rough me up and break me down baby don't stop now.

Oh you can use me up till it all runs out
Baby don't stop now
I'm all yours, i'm all yours somehow
Baby don't stop now

I said where i come from you learn to make the best of things
And honey since we met
Oh you known you've had the best of me
So you can lock me up
Yeah baby throw away that key
Because all i know is that this is where i want to be.

So you can rough me up you can break me down
Baby don't stop now.
Oh you can use me up till it all runs out
Baby don't stop now

I'm all yours, i'm all yours somehow
Baby don't stop now
You can rough me up you can break me down
Baby don't stop now
Oh you can use me up till it all runs out
Baby don't 

You can rough me up you can break me down
Baby don't stop now
Oh you can use me up till it all runs out
Baby don't stop now

I'm all yours, i'm all yours somehow
Baby don't stop now
No honey don't stop now
Oh baby don't stop now---Lyrics submitted by adrienne.
