Surrounded by familiar faces
The people that you love to see
Where everybody knows your name
And they're smiling
And we may not be getting younger
Our days might be slipping away
Yeah, we're still so fucking young
So we'll party like it's our last day

And for the first time
I feel less alone
And for the first time
I can call this home

It's our last time, to say goodnight
Don't say goodbye cuz' in the morning we'll
See you around, and we'll sing it again
Same time tomorrow, yeah we'll all join in

I'm ashamed of feeling done now
Cuz we're with people we've been waiting on
All we needed were some good friends
And a song to sing along (a song to sing along)
With voices yelling in the front room
No one could tell us keep it down
So we all just kept it loud and tried to wake the entire town

And for the first time
I felt tless alone
And for the first time
I can call this home

It's our last time to say goodnight
Don't say goodbye cuz in the morning we'll
See you around and and we'll sing it again
Same time tomorrow, yeah we'll all join in

It's our last time to say goodnight
Don't say goodbye cuz in the morning we'll
See you around and we'll sing it again
Same time tomorrow, yeah we'll all join in

Each days a number
But we can't forget last summer
When we say we do, we're on until the end
Go on and sing it now
Our days are numbered
And we know we're getting younger
But it's night like these that make you not really care (x2)

We all have been degraded
We all have been the greateset
We all have been degraded
We all will be the greatest---Lyrics submitted by Kara.
