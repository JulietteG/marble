Baby my ears are open,
And I'm watching you,
That language your body's speaking,
It makes me sick.
And you're not so smooth,
Cause you do it for the thrill.
And I'm watching you.
You know I'm watching you.

Cause you're in love with love,
You're not in love with him.
And I can tell by the way you play it off,
Like you don't know what you're doing to him.

We've heard all about you,
We know you're every move,
Cause you're paper thin,
And it's visible.
And with or without you,
He'll make it through,
Cause you're paper thin,
And it's visible.

When I get the chance,
To expose the truth,
I'm gonna make my move,
I'm gonna make my move.
Cause you're all two sides,
And you're struggling,
We won't let this slide,
No baby not this time.

Cause you're in love with love,
You're not in love with him.
And I can tell by the way you play it off,
Like you don't know what you're doing to him.

We've heard all about you,
We know you're every move,
Cause you're paper thin,
And it's visible.
And with or without you,
He'll make it through,
Cause you're paper thin,
And it's visible---Lyrics submitted by Karina.
