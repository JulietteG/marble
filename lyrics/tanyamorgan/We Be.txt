[Chorus]
 The almighty Tanya Morgan, you know it (We, We Be) x4

 Im goin hard for Tanya, and I -
Cant stand most of the stanzas - that I -
I hear litter in the air waves, hear the play the better way, let it play-youre ears will say; D***, that N***** made my day!

I Hate the way super-n**** says that n***** get it twisted, they figure with persistence til you tempted to get one of this- And They dont know the difference as a witness givin this was written
- if it aint hittin no dissin I keep it real wit em.
 feel the ?????
are you based to realism or fiction - we lend - rhythmadiction - let you pay it back with interest
used to get the feds up here, you like the last line of defense, the future of the game dog, you sound a little wheezy Come on-


[Chorus]

From Exploring the seven seas to the shores of Emcees minds I climb beneath the sublime tryin to remind em of what it needs to be in times of turmoil, so my blood boils to the surface on the Earths soil, Im a volcano!
My saliva is lava
setting flame to the plains my words fame
I bring the worst pain like Curt Cobain
I found a ????
The last dragon never get slain - I got the glow
Shown up!
next stop my show
You know what?
This is my shot to rock to the top of hip-hop on every block keepin it locked, keepin it cocked since the rock,
before you pop this in your drop top
sir youll have to turn it up!
Its too hot I need to stop cause the mic is burnin up!


[Chorus]


All I really want to do is get a chick from myspace to freak off on the first day like blind date

You aint hardcore, you just sell crack cause you aint make job core-
furthermore I never heard em more,
School version of real,
you a player but you aint have no endorsement deal,
I aint write for weeks and never lost my skill,
never lost the flow, when of course I kill
when he beat you past me-
you want a beat make a track,
go head ask me
I sent a thing kid its tighter than Chastity - raps Holy Grail
before it was blasphemy - you aint bad as we be.
