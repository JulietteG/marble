Did you ever feel lonely crying by yourself 
Did you ever feel lonely when you're crying by yourself 
When the woman that you're loving is with some body else 

You lie awake at night just calling out her name... 
Yes, you lie awake at night just calling out her name 
And you know your heart is breaking 
And it's such a crying shame 

Did you ever feel lonely when you're crying by yourself 
Yes, did you ever feel lonely when you're crying by yourself 
When the woman that you're in love with 
Is lying down with some one else 

You lie awake at night just calling out her name... 

Did you ever feel empty like there is nothing left inside 
Did you ever feel empty like there is nothing left inside 
When you know that she won't love you 
No matter how many tears you cry.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
