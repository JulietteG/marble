I bask in the light and swim through the gradation of the waterside
I embrace the bright rainbow in the sky

Good-bye star!
Even the fish and each drop of water is shining

I wonder if you can see this world too
I wonder if there are dreams on the other side of this sky too
Someday Ill quietly reach out my hand
Into the beyond

I hear a distant memory and a strange meditation
I whisper with the spreading prism of stars

Ive been looking at it forever

I wonder if you can see this world too
I wonder if there are dreams on the other side of this sky too
This feeling that races along, carrying my love
Becomes a precious memory
Someday Ill quietly reach out my hand
Into the beyond---Lyrics submitted by Aubrey Anonymous.
