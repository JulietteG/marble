A distant world that cools and freezes like snow,
Where maybe nothing ever moves, just waiting for a miracle





Rainbow hanging in the sky
Not a single person to see
That image disappears in the hands of a person seeing a dream




If you bury every word you can remember,
you might be able to see
the shining view on the other side of the window



A distant world that cools and freezes like snow,
Where maybe nothing ever moves, just waiting for a miracle




At some point when the wind blows, these stars will probably understand
the infinite darkness expanding on the other side of the sky



Rainbow hanging in the sky
See a dream




If you bury every word you can remember,
you might be able to see
The shining view on the other side of the window



A distant world that cools and freezes like snow,
Where maybe nothing ever moves, just waiting for a miracle



A distant world that cools and freezes like snow,
Where maybe nothing ever moves, just waiting for a miracle

Lala lalalalalalalala
Lala lalalalalalalala lala



Rainbow hanging in the sky
See a dream



Rainbow hanging in the sky
See a dream ---
