Talk to me, dont lie to me
Save your breath
Dont look at me, dont smile at me
Just close your eyes
I was so impressed by you
I was running blind
I would fall for every trick
Every twist of mind

Heaven is cold
Without any soul
Its hard to believe
I was so in love with you

Dont say your prayers, dont build your hopes
Just walk away
Dont phone me up, dont call around
Dont waste your time
You were so in awe of me
You were so divine
You would do just anything
To still be mine

Heaven is cold
Without any soul
Its hard to believe
I was so in love with you

All the things you said to me
I was so obsessed
You were always talking talking
God I did my best

Heaven is cold
Without any soul
Its hard to believe
I was so in love with you---Lyrics submitted by Urtubia.
