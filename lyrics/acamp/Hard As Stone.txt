In the morning
And in the evening
When you think
You're alone
Too many hours
In your apartment
Has made me
Hard as a stone

I've tried to crack you
I told you you're the one
But you must have thought
That I have gone
I told you a lotta lies
Just to get laid
But your heart is
Hard as a stone

You're vicious
But I'm a man
I'm gonna do
What I can
To remain
Hard as a stone

That little pigeon
Where did you find her
I had to break her
Every bone
Eleven hours
In your pool
No longer
Hard as a stone

She was delicious
Now I'm the star
If you wanna be
What you are
You've gotta be
Hard as a stone
Hard as a stone
Ha-ha-ha-hard as a stone

You're mean
But I'm a man
It's not exactly
What I planned
But it seems
I'm hard as a stone
I'm hard as a stone
Seems I'm hard as a stone---Lyrics submitted by Christine.
