Mama, I've found someone, like you said would come along 
 She has no snout, but she's no doubt, the biggest pig I've known 
 I thought that she would help me with the laundry and the chores 
 But there are those who won't wash clothes, 
 And guess who's scrubbin' the floors.

 Mama she's lazy, lazier than me 
 And on my couch is where she says, she's always gonna be
 I've never slept that long, she beats all I've ever seen 
 Mama she's lazy, she's lazier than me.

 And mama, you always said - get the lead out of your pants 
 But that old phrase don't phase her daze, she's always in a trance 
 She's hung up on the movie stars, on the afternoon TV 
 And now I'm concerned she ain't worth a dern, 
 And I can't even get her to leave.

 Mama she's lazy, lazier than me 
 And on my couch is where she says, she's always gonna be 
 She's never swept the floor, since she swept me off my feet 
 Mama she's lazy, she's lazier than me---Lyrics submitted by Chris Philpot.
