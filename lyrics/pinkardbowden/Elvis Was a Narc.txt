Who's that comin' through the park 
 Dress in rhinestones after dark 
 Lookin' way too fat to be a cop 
 Keepin' Memphis clean from his long black limousine 
 Fightin' crime with fast karate chops 

 Oh, now, Elvis was a narc 
 In rhinestones after dark 
 He did his best to keep Memphis drug-free 
 He knew every pill he'd eat 
 Would be one less on the street 
 Elvis took 'em all for you and me 

 Now I still can't believe 
 That the King would have O.D.'d 
 And he couldn't have done the drugs they say he did 
 And even though he's D.O.A. 
 I still hear people say 
 That he's got 'em all out in Graceland somewhere hid 

 Oh, well, Elvis was a narc 
 In rhinestones after dark 
 He did his best to keep Memphis drug-free 
 He knew every pill he'd eat 
 Would be one less on the street 
 Elvis took 'em all for you and me---Lyrics submitted by Chris Philpot.
